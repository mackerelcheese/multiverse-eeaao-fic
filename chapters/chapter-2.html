        <p>“My Remus apologises to the door when it stubs his toe,” Sirius grumbles. “How are both of you even remotely the same person?” </p>
        <p>Prime Remus clicks the door of the empty office space locked behind them and Sirius collapses onto the floor huffing. A part of Sirius hopes that maybe this is all an elaborate prank for Sirius to start working out with James in the mornings.   </p>
        <p>Prime Remus plops next to him and Sirius rolls slightly to look up at him. “You underestimate how the smallest changes can affect how a person lives. With enough willpower and imagination, even the smallest ripple can turn into a tidal wave. Every tiny change, the smallest of choices in a person’s life can branch out to a different universe in the timeline. That’s how the multiverse grows.” </p>
        <p>Prime Remus pulls out his watch, the digital display warping before turning into a little green flashing GPS pin with the words “<strong>University!” </strong>at the bottom. “This is your universe - the one we’re in right now.” </p>
        <p>“There are other paths around it that are all the other possible universes made up of all the choices you didn’t take,” Prime Remus explains.“Green means it’s safe and it’s close to your current timeline. The ones in red are further away from your timeline. The further away it is, the more differences there are compared  to your universe - and the more dangerous it is to jump to.” </p>
        <p>The infodump is almost too much to even comprehend. “A universe for everything?” Sirius asks in disbelief.  </p>
        <p>“Yup.” </p>
        <p>Sirius pushes himself up on his elbows. “So there’s a universe where I don’t have to worry about hell week or whatever the heck is going on now?” he asks.   </p>
        <p>“Theoretically, yes.” </p>
        <p>“Practically?”  </p>
        <p>Prime Remus blinks harshly. “Yeah, sure. One with no ‘hell week’.”</p>
        <p>Sirius lets himself fall back down onto the floor. “Okay, how do we go there instead?” </p>
        <p>Prime Remus pulls Sirius up to his knees and rolls his eyes, <em>again. </em>“That’s not how this works.” </p>
        <p>Suddenly there is the sound of footsteps outside and Sirius’ blood runs cold. There is a slight thump as the person in the hallway makes their way towards Sirius and Prime Remus.</p>
        <p>Prime Remus’ hand encircles his wrist and he’s being tugged under a desk. Prime Remus moves the chair to block them both from sight and they pause.  </p>
        <p>The footsteps grow louder and louder. A figure blocks the light from underneath the door casting a small shadow. </p>
        <p>Shoulder to shoulder, Sirius and Remus hold their breaths, waiting for the shadow underneath the door to walk away. </p>
        <p>A walkie-talkie beeps and static comes over the line. “Mad-Eye come in, there’s movement on the first floor,” the static-y voice says.  </p>
        <p>“Copy,” a man grumbles from the other side of the door. “Units 2 and 3, head to floor 1 now. Stay vigilant, there is no sign of the weapon or assailant yet.” </p>
        <p>The footsteps make their way further and further but Sirius still can’t breathe out. There’s a heavy weight squeezing his lungs. Whoever sat at this desk must have short legs because there isn’t any space under it. The air is hot and heavy and suffocating and <em>there is no room to fucking breathe</em>. </p>
        <p>He knows he covered anxiety attacks back in first-year classes but all of that info goes flying out the window. What’s the point of taking all those classes if Sirius can’t even remember how to box breathe? Fucking useless, he can’t do anything right - not even something as simple as breathing correctly. All Sirius wants to do is go home and hide under the covers. </p>
        <p>“Did you know owls have three eyelids?” </p>
        <p>Sirius swallows the saliva building in his mouth and looks at Prime Remus who is fiddling with his watch.  </p>
        <p>“Their eyes are also technically tubes,” he says nonchalantly.  </p>
        <p>Sirius squints at him, before finally rearranging his thoughts.“The fuck?” </p>
        <p>“Maybe it's different in your universe, but where I’m from, they don’t have teeth either, so they just swallow everything whole.” </p>
        <p class="SOB-thought">What the fuck is he on? </p>
        <p>Prime Remus turns to him with a familiar shit-eating grin when Sirius doesn’t reply. “It's something we have in common.” </p>
        <p>Sirius snorts and immediately covers his mouth to muffle the sound. Prime Remus smiles softly at him. </p>
        <p>Sirius breathes out before immediately wanting to burst out laughing again at the absurdity. It takes a few moments but his shoulders finally relax from where it was tensed up around his ears. Sirius leans his head back against the plastic back. </p>
        <p>Prime Remus shoots him a small smile. “Better?” </p>
        <p>Sirius takes in a shuddering breath and his heart slows down from its rabbit’s pace. “Yeah.” </p>
        <p>“Here I want to show you something,” Prime Remus says, pressing his body closer to Sirius, letting the soft green glow of the watch shine on them both. “This is where I’m from.”</p>

    <p>“Come on people, keep a stable line!” someone yells into the microphone. In front of them are a legion of screens - each one showing different versions of Remus John Lupin going about their lives. </p>

    <p>The windows in James and Sirius’ flat are boarded up, with sunlight peeking through the cracks where the wood splintered from age. All of the walls are covered with various flashing screens and pictures connected by red threads on a corkboard. The sandstorm outside roils and shakes the boarded windows.  </p>

    <p>Prime Remus sits in a chair hooked up to all sorts of machinery and flashing lights. A huge headset sits on top of his face with wires sticking up from every angle.  </p>

    <p>“We call it the Prime Universe,” he says into a small microphone.  </p>

    <p>Projected on one of the screens is Prime Remus and Sirius' universe, hidden under a desk huddled up next to Sirius. As he speaks, the one on the screen does as well.   </p>

    <p>“It started when a group of scientists discovered the technology to visit another universe. The multiverse branches out based on a person’s choices - the ones they took and all the options they didn’t. But that also means that a singular individual stumbling into the right place at the right time can open a whole new world of technology and powers we at the Prime verse cannot even begin to comprehend.”   </p>

    <p>At the corner of the screen in front of Prime Remus’, there is a yellowing worn picture of Sirius in a lab coat smiling wide at the camera. </p>

    <p>He clenches his jaw before forcing himself to relax. Prime Remus closes his eyes and lets himself remember what it’s like to have his Sirius by his side again. </p>

    <p>Sirius’ shoulder bumps against Prime Remus’.</p>
    <p>“So, like the closet, like Prime you…” Sirius gestures uselessly.</p>
    <p>“Yes, it's all universes different from yours based on different decisions people have made. We call it Verse Jumping - now I <em>really</em> need you to pay attention because you’re going to have to master it.”   </p>
    <p>“Now?” Sirius sputters.  </p>
    <p>“It’s the only way you can make it out of here alive.” </p>
    <p>Sirius wants to gag when Prime Remus picks a chewing gum stuck on the underside of the desk and pops it in his mouth. </p>
    <p>The watch ticks and Prime Remus looks up with more clarity than before, “I can hear three guards coming down this way. There’s a group of students running. If we hurry we can blend in.”</p>
    <p>He spits out the gum and sticks it back underneath the table and Sirius has to close his eyes to hide his grimace. </p>
    <p>“We’re going to have to make a move. Follow my lead,” Prime Remus crawls out from under the table and grabs Sirius’ wrist. </p>
    <p>“Wait, stop!” Sirius tugs his hand out Prime Remus’ grasp. “Why can’t your Sirius do this?” </p>
    <p>Prime Remus looks off to the side. </p>
    <p>“My Sirius is dead.” </p>
    
    <p class="SOB-thought">Oh. </p>
    
    <p>This time, Sirius lets him pull him towards the door. </p>
    <p>“Follow my lead,” Prime Remus instructs before going out of the room and joining the other students running down the hall. In a high-pitched voice, he yells “Oh my god, oh my god.” </p>
    <p>Sirius would be lying if he said that he never thought about dying before. </p>
    <p>But to <em>know</em> another version of him <em>is</em> dead, that somehow in another life, he <em><strong>died.</strong></em> </p>
    <p>Being a student isn’t particularly a dangerous pastime but it seems like every other student worth their grade has joked about getting hurt or dying - getting hit by a university campus vehicle so your fees are paid for, not wearing a seatbelt when your friend is driving because if you crash and die, you don’t have to finish the assignment you procrastinated on. </p>
    <p>When the world beats you down, it's easier to want to toe the line between life and death. But to actually be dead?</p>
    <p>Sirius is only 21. It’s not enough time.</p>
    <p>His palms are uncomfortably sweaty as they round another corner away from the other students and into the library.</p>    
    <p>When doors close behind them, Sirius asks bluntly, “How did I die?” </p>
    <p>Prime Remus straightens his back and starts scanning the place like a seasoned soldier. A part of Sirius wonders if Prime Remus heard him at all. </p>
    <p>Prime Remus grabs Sirius’ arm and pulls him to crouch behind some shelving. Sirius; back is against the shelf and the books dig into his spine but he can’t quite move with Prime Remus’ hand still on his arm, Sirius wonders if he should repeat the question - if it's something worth knowing. </p>
    <p>But he doesn’t have to because maybe every version of Remus can read his mind. Prime Remus’ breath tickles Sirius’ ear as he leans in to whisper, “I’ve seen you die hundreds of thousands of times.” </p>
    <p>Sirius wonders if Prime Remus can hear his heart thumping. </p>
    <p>Prime Remus takes a deep breath and says softly, “You were murdered in mine.” </p>
    
    <p class="SOB-thought">Murder.</p>

    <p>“Was it the, the,” Sirius stumbles over the words. How does one come to terms with their own death that has happened hundreds of thousands of times? “What did you call it? The obstacle?”</p>
    <p>“Obscurial.” </p>
    <p>“And no one really knows why?”</p>
    <p>Prime Remus makes a slight disagreeing sound. “Well, there are some theories,” Prime Remus rubs the back of his neck and furrows his brow. “Mathematically out of the millions of universes, there has to be at least one person who can defeat him right? He thinks it's you.” </p>
    <p>“Let him destroy the other universes then,” Sirius points out, inches away from pleading. “Just leave me alone.” </p>
    <p>“It's not that easy. He’s been making something. We don’t know exactly what it is, but he has garnered a following across the different universes,” Prime Remus disagrees. “You feel it, don’t you? How your clothes never quite fit the same way? Every day feels the same and your actions aren’t your own.” </p>
    
    <p class="SOB-thought"><s>Swiping endlessly on a phone screen in the early hours of the morning.</s></p>
    
    <p>“Like how you don’t even know how to be yourself or what that looks like anymore.” </p>
    
    <p class="SOB-thought"><s>Trying to get back into old hobbies only for it to gather dust in a spare room. </s></p>
    
    <p>“And you spend the rest of your time wondering -” </p>
    
    <p class="SOB-thought"><s>Having a to-do list of all the tasks you need to get done so you can get your life on track again, but never completing any of it.</s></p>
    
    <p>“How can we get back,” Sirius finishes Prime Remus’ train of thought.  </p>
    <p>“Exactly,” Prime Remus affirms, nodding his head. “This is the objective of the Prime Universe. We just want things to go back to the way it was - the way it's supposed to be.” </p>
    <p> “The Prime Universe’s directive is to restore the balance - bring stability back to the chaos and destruction the Obscurial is causing. And we have to start by finding the person who can put a stop to it all. Someone who can bring order back to the multiverse,” Prime Remus finishes, looking into Sirius’ eyes as if trying to study his reaction.  </p>
    <p>“And you think it's me?” </p>
    <p>“Why else would I risk it all?” </p>
    <p>Sirius wets his lip. It's dry and chapped and he can feel the skin peeling. Before he can reply, someone in the distance slams a drawer shut. </p>
    <p>Peeking beside the shelving, the two see Barty, rummaging through the clerk’s desk before pulling out a stapler. He picks up a pink sticky note and - </p>
    
    <p class="middle"><strong>CLICK</strong> </p>
    
    <p>- staples it directly onto his forehead without even flinching. Barty looks up and a small trail of blood trickles down the bridge of his nose. </p>
    <p>A creeping feeling starts crawling on Sirius’ arms and he whispers to Prime Remus, “What is Barty doing?” </p>
    <p>“That’s not your Barty,” Prime Remus fiddles with his watch. “He’s jumped.” </p>

    <p>“Meadows, where did Crouch go?” Prime Remus hurriedly asks the person next to him. </p>

    <p>“Not sure,” she replies, scanning the numbers flashing on her screen. “Something about watching a lot of TV when he was young.” </p>

    <p>“He’s a pro-wrestler. Shit,” Prime Remus mutters. </p>
    <p>Pro-wrestler? Barty is all skin and bones, a strong breeze could knock him over. Sirius peeks around the desk - Barty seems… taller. Maybe it’s because he stopped hunching and finally straightened his back but there’s no way that he could be <em>a pro-wrestler</em>.  </p>
    <p>“I’m going to need a jumping pad,” Prime Remus whispers frantically into his watch. “Something that can get us out of here.”  </p>

    <p><strong>SLICE</strong>. </p>
    <p>Prime Remus pulls the sheet In a quick downward motion between his middle and pointer fingers. There is a trail of blood on the edge of the paper.  </p>
    <p>“What are you doing?”  Sirius hisses as Prime Remus lines it up in between the next two fingers. </p>
    <p><strong>SLICE. </strong></p>
    <p>Barty’s head snaps in the direction of the whispers. Kicking a piece of broken chair out of the way, Barty staggers down the aisles of bookshelves.</p>
    <p>“Remus, Remus -” Sirius starts hitting Prime Remus’ arm. </p>
    <p>“Hang on,” Prime Remus whispers harshly back. “I almost have it.” </p>

    <p>Up close, Sirius can see the small bloom of blood on the pink sticky note on Barty’s forehead. It's closer than Sirius would like. </p>

    <p><strong>SLICE.</strong></p>
    <p>The watch turns green and before Prime Remus can even breathe a sigh of relief, something grabs his hand. </p>
    <p>Barty looks down at Prime Remus kneeling on the floor before lifting the chair. Prime Remus lifts his hands to shield his face as the chair smashes into him and sends him flying into the neighbouring bookshelf. </p>
    <p>Barty picks up the leg of the chair and stalks towards Prime Remus. Prime Remus scrambles to his hand to press the button on the watch. </p>
    <p>His wrist is empty.</p>

    <p>A message pops up on Sirius' watch.</p>

    <div class="watch-strap black-bg"></div>
    <div class="watch-con black-bg">
    SAY I LOVE YOU TO B. CROUCH JR. 
    </div>
    <div class="watch-strap black-bg">
    <div>•</div><div>•</div><div>•</div>
    </div>

    <p>Sirius blinks. Blinks again.</p>
    <p>“What?! No way,” he protests.  </p>
    <p>“It's the best chance you’ve got,” Prime Remus says through the watch. “It's just like switching shoes or giving yourself a papercut. The multiverse depends on it.”</p>
    <p>“The fate of the multiverse cannot hang on if I can, what - profess my love to <em>Barty Crouch Junior</em> of all people.” </p>

    <br/>

    <p>“The mental load it takes to universe jump is too much for a mind to handle. The algorithm scientists developed an algorithm that calculates the improbable action you need to make that jump safely,” Prime Remus explains calmly. </p>
    <p>“The best jumping pads are the ones where you make odd choices or are completely out of character - something weird enough for the multi-universal physics itself to attempt to overcorrect and blip you across the multiverse.” </p>

    <p>“It doesn’t make any sense!” Sirius whisper-shouts into the watch. </p>
    <p>“Precisely,” Prime Remus agrees. “It needs to <em>not</em> make sense. The Algorithmic Objective Outbound Opportunities formula counts on weirdness and improbability.”  </p>
    <p>“There <em>has</em> to be another jumping pad.” </p>
    <p>“Your other options are to break your legs or sleep with him on the same bed. Are either of you tired?”  </p>
    <p>“That can’t be the only -” </p>
    <p>Dirty sneakers with loose laces stop in front of the desk. Sirius looks up to see Barty looking down at him. </p>
    <p class="SOB-thought">Shit.</p>
    <p>Barty casually flips the desk Sirius hides under. </p>
    <p>“I love you?” Sirius says meekly.</p>

    <p>Remus and Sirius are sitting on the sofa. Regulus and James aren’t home yet. </p>
    <p>“Look, I -” Remus starts. “I don’t want us to end like this.” </p>
    <p>Sirius’ lungs cannot take in enough air and there is the ghost of pinpricks on his neck. “No, no, no -” </p>

    <p>Sirius gets up and throws his fist which Barty catches easily. </p>
    <p>Sirius’ wrist burns with blinding white hot pain as Barty twists his fist. He grits his teeth not wanting to let Barty get the satisfaction. </p>
    <p>The back of Sirius’ mind knows that he has survived worse - every punch and kick his parents gave him should have thickened his skin. But it's been years since someone laid their hands on him. </p>
    <p>He’s soft now. </p>

    <p>Sirius’ face is turning red as he tries to hold in the pain. He clenches his fists in his jeans willing for some kind of control. </p>
    <p>“I don’t want to hurt you. I didn’t mean for it to end this way,” Remus says softly. “It's just - Marlene said that she and Dorcas took a break when Dorcas moved to Diagon. That the long-distance talks made them even closer.” </p>
    <p>Sirius flinches as if someone physically hits him. “It doesn’t make any sense.” </p>
    <p>“Think about it!” Remus buries his face in his hands. “We barely have a conversation where we’re not talking over each other. When was the last time we spent time together? When was the last time we <em>really </em>listened to each other?”</p>
    <p>A hand lands on Sirius’ shoulder.</p>

    <p>Barty grabs Sirius by the shoulders and tosses him against the wall by the study room. </p>
    <p>Blinking through the haze in his mind, he sees Prime Remus on the other side of the shelf, peeking through a gap in the books that block his way out.</p>
    <p>“I didn’t mean for it to end this way,” Prime Remus says softly. </p>
    <p>“No,” Sirius croaks out. </p>
    <p>“I need to find the right Sirius,” Prime Remus sighs apologetically. “This one… it's not the one.” </p>
    <p>“Wait, let me try again,” Sirius pleads, crawling towards the gap in the bottom bookshelf Prime Remus is looking through. </p>
    <p class="SOB-thought">Please.</p>
    <p>“I’m sorry, Sirius.” Prime Remus stands, his face out of view.    </p>
    <p class="SOB-thought">Let me be someone to you.</p>
    <p>There is a soft gasp on the other side of the bookshelf and Sirius can only close his eyes. </p>
    <p>“Sirius?” Remus crouches down to the gap again, glasses back on his face. “Oh my god, what happened to your face?” </p>

    <p>“Come on,” Sirius pushes himself up. Looking around the room - just like Prime Remus - Barty seems to have made a run for it too. He puts his hands on each side of the bookshelf, “Lift the other side.”</p>

    <p>They tilt the bookshelf out of the way and Remus, his Remus stumbles and climbs out. </p>

    <p>“Shit, Sirius. What's going on?” Remus gingerly wipes the blood from Sirius’ cheek.  </p>

    <p>“You left me,” Sirius mutters in a daze.  </p>

    <p>“What?,” Remus says confused. “Is this about the internship?”</p>

    <!--HOME-->

    <div class="gen-flexcon">

    <p>“I wanted to end the semester on the right foot. But it wasn’t fair of me, especially with everything going on with Regulus,” Remus confesses quietly, his eyebrows tense. “Maybe, maybe you are right. We should have never gotten together.”</p>
    <p>“I never said that,” Sirius says lamely.  </p>
    <p>“You don’t have to,” Remus argues. “It's how you talk to me - always cutting me off and rushing to do something else. It’s how we don’t talk about anything that isn’t about school, work, or our friends.” </p>
    <p>Sirius wants to say how it's not fair, he wants to argue and shout but the words just can’t come out. </p>
    <p>The door for the spare bedroom at the end of the hallway bursts open. </p>

    <p>Standing behind Remus at the other end of the hallway is Barty. </p>
    <p>“I love you,” Sirius blurts out. </p>
    <p>Remus’ face softens but his eyebrows furrow. “What?” </p>
    <p>Sirius pushes Remus out of the way. </p>
    <p>“I love you I love you I love you -” Sirius manically chants. </p>
    <p>The watch glows yellow. </p>
    <p class="SOB-thought">Fuck, it’s not enough.</p>
    <p>“Barty? What are you doing -” Sirius cuts Remus off by grabbing his hand and running down the other direction. Sirius pulls the emergency doors open and pulls Remus down the stairs. </p>
    <p>They make it to the first landing when Barty throws the doors open again. </p>
    <p class="SOB-thought">Love, love, love -</p>
    <p>What does confessing your love even mean? Apparently, empty words that mean nothing do not affect what the universe wants. </p>
    <p>Sirius thinks back to the Barty he knows - the sarcastic little shit but one of the most intelligent people in that class. Sirius looks back at Remus who looks like he’s shaking with fear behind him. </p>
    <p>Smart but sarcastic? That’s a type that Sirius can work with. </p>
    <p>Barty gets ready to jump - like a pro wrestler jumping off the corners of the ring moments before slamming their opponent on the floor. </p>
    <p class="SOB-thought">Just stop worrying and let yourself feel.</p>
    <p>Sirius drops to his knees in the middle of the stairwell. Earnestly thinking about how Barty is actually kind of hot from certain angles and his sharp wit over text has made Sirius snort once or twice, he professes his love. </p>
    <p>“I love you.” </p>

        <p class="rs-1p">International rockstar, Sirius Black, is now the leading man in The Phoenix Studios’ latest instalment of the beloved Mad Dog franchise. He has spent the last 4 months in Thailand training for this role and is finally back home.</p>
        <p class="rs-p">We at Witch Weekly managed to sit down with the illusive man himself to ask all the details our readers are dying to know.</p>
        <p class="rs-p"><strong>WITCH WEEKLY:</strong> Thank you for agreeing to this interview Sirius. I’ll cut to the chase, all the girls want to know, Sirius, is there a lucky lady in your life? </p>
        <p class="rs-p"><strong>SIRIUS BLACK:</strong> A girlfriend? [Laughs] No, not at the moment. My career has taken off in so many ways I can’t even begin to think about being in a relationship. </p>
        <p class="rs-p"><strong>WW:</strong> A man like you must have hundreds of girls, and boys, lining up waiting for you. </p>
        <p class="rs-p"><strong>Sirius: </strong>[Laughs] The fans are wonderful. But no, haven’t been with anyone in a long time. </p>
        <p class="rs-p"><strong>WW:</strong> A shame. Okay let’s talk about the movie - it’s your debut! Is it true that you learnt martial arts specifically for this role? </p>
        <div class="fadeout">
            <p class="rs-p"><strong>Sirius:</strong> Yes, that’s true. But I like to think that I’ve always been a good fighter. </p>     
            <p class="rs-p"><strong>WW:</strong>Can you tell us more about that? </p>

    <p>There are 8 points of contact on the body that are used in Muay Thai - two shins, two knees, two elbows, and two fists. </p>
    <p>Sirius’ movements are controlled and precise.  </p>
    <p>He slides his right foot in behind his left and widens his stance. His weight shifts to the ball of his left foot. His right bounces slightly just waiting and ready to be swung forward. </p>
    <p>His fists are in front of his face like a boxer’s - close enough to protect his face, far enough so his opponents can’t slam it back into his jaw.  </p>
    <p>There is a moment when Barty flies at him that feels as if time itself has slowed down. </p>
    <p class="SOB-thought"><s>Or is it Sirius who moves quickly?</s></p>
    <p>With unfamiliar agility, Sirius punches Barty as his classmate flies towards him. It stops the momentum of Barty’s jump and sends him careening into the stairs he just leapt off from. </p>
    <p>Barty pushes himself off the stairs to grab Sirius who evades by ducking underneath his outstretched arm. He grabs Barty by the shoulder and pulls him in close so that when Sirius slams his knee upwards, it connects with the soft tissue of Barty’s stomach. </p>
    <p>Barty cries out in pain as he staggers to stand upright. </p>
    <p>Another thing about Muay Thai is that <em>proper timing</em> is the best leverage you can have against your opponent. </p>
    <p>So when Barty lunges forward, Sirius just has to quickly lift his arm for Barty to slam face-first into his elbow. </p>
    <p>In the brief moment that Barty is off-balanced, Sirius roundhouse kicks him, sending Barty flying down the stairs.  </p>
    <p>Barty falls unconscious at the bottom of the stairs, his breathing evening out.  </p>
    <p>“Oh my god,” Remus finally exclaims. </p>
    <p>“It worked.” Sirius stares at his hands and whispers to himself.   </p>
    <p>Adrenaline pumps through his veins. In another life, he was a rockstar on stage who could fight his way through his problems. </p>
    <p>Sirius has never felt more alive in his life. His eyes begin to well up with tears. </p>
    <p>It’s beautiful. </p>
    <p>“Wha-? Why are you crying? I -” Remus asks moving to brush Sirius’ tears away. </p>
    <p>Sirius’ mind is filled with the life he never got to have, one where he isn’t a coward who runs away. </p>
    <p>“I saw,” Sirius swallows, trying to fight back tears. “I saw a world where we never got together. You should have seen it…”</p>
    <p>Remus leans in closer to Sirius.  </p>
    <p>“It was beautiful. I should have never run away all those years ago. Should have learned how to fight back…” </p>
    <p>Somewhere through the high of the verse jump, Sirius can tell that Remus’ face falls. But Sirius can’t find it in him to think about that. The only thing on his mind is how can he <em>go back go back go back go back go back - </em></p>
    <p>He reaches for the watch again when a hand stops him. </p>
    <p>“Come on,” Prime Remus takes the glasses off his face. “We have a lot to do.” </p>
    <p>Prime Remus pulls Sirius down the stairs before running back out into the building. </p>
    <p>“No, no,” Sirius says in a daze as Prime Remus pokes his head around the corner of the dark hallway again. “My Re-remus, he needs to know how good life could have been.” </p>

    <p>His thoughts grow quiet as static begins to fill his ears. </p>

    <p>Prime Remus is saying something but Sirius can’t make out the words.</p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="overlappingtexttop">
    <p>Prime Remus says something but Sirius can’t make sense of the words coming out of his mouth.</p>
    <div class="overlappingtextbottom">
        <p>The crowd roars as fans push themselves against the barricade.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="overlappingtexttop">
    <p>Prime Remus holds Sirius’ hand and pulls him along to…. somewhere.</p>
    <div class="overlappingtextbottom">
        <p>“Sirius! Are the rumours true? Is your dick really that big?"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="overlappingtexttop">
    <p>Oh, that’s weird.</p>
    <div class="overlappingtextbottom">
        <p>“Sirius! Sirius! Have my babies!”</p>

    <div class="overlappingtextbottom">

        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="overlappingtexttop">
    <p>Sirius looks up to see Prime Remus saying something again. </p>
    <div class="overlappingtextbottom">
        <p>“Sirius!” “Oh my god, hi!” Suddenly, she unbuttons her blouse.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="overlappingtexttop">
    <p>Prime Remus’ hands move to grip Sirius’ shoulders.</p>
    <div class="overlappingtextbottom">
        <p>“I'd be honoured if you signed my tits,” the blushing face says shyly.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="overlappingtexttop">
    <p>“Sirius!” Prime Remus yells, shaking him.</p>
    <div class="overlappingtextbottom">
        <p>“Sirius!” “Sirius!” "Sirius, we all love you!"</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="overlappingtexttop">
    <p>“Sirius!”</p>
    <div class="overlappingtextbottom">
        <p>"Sirius!” "Look here! We love you!</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>“SIRIUS!” Prime Remus shouts right into Sirius’ ear before slapping him. Sirius blinks as vision returns and the harsh sting blooms on his cheek.</p>
    <p>“I thought I was disconnected,” Sirius says, bringing up his hand to rub the side of his cheek. “How- how did I go back there?”</p> 
    <p>Sirius looks around as Prime Remus rummages through the candy jar by the counter and pulls out a couple of chocolate bars. Sirius was so out of it that he didn’t even realise that they made it to the staff pantry and he was on the tiled floor. </p>
    <p>“Your mind is like a clay pot. Jumping will cause the pot to crack and that is how your mind can flow into a different universe. You need to learn how to reseal those cracks,” Prime Remus says rummaging through more cabinets before sliding down next to Sirius on the floor.   </p>
    <p>“Eat this,” Prime Remus says, holding out the chocolate. “It’ll make you feel better.” </p>
    <p>Sirius takes the chocolate into his hands, twisting the wrapper with his fingers but not quite opening it.  </p>
    <p>“Oh, yeah this is the good stuff,” Prime Remus wolfs down on the chocolate hungrily before grabbing another bar. “One of the first few things we lost in the Prime universe is chocolate production. No one wants to pick cacao beans when the world is falling apart.” </p>
    <p>“This is really confusing,” Sirius confesses, pressing his thumb against his temple. “Nothing you’re saying makes sense - magic, murder, and a worldwide chocolate shortage?” </p>
    <p>“Chocolate extinction,” Prime Remus corrects, licking the wrapper of every trace of the sweet. Sirius’ Remus is a mild-mannered student. Prime Remus is so - so different. More manic, more desperate, more outspoken, more… <em>more</em>. </p>
    <p>Even in the fighting universe, Sirius was so much more than who he is now. </p>
    <p>Maybe Prime Remus was right - this universe is the worst version out there.  </p>
    <p>“What, what if I want to go back?” Sirius asks in a small voice. </p>
    <p>“No!” Prime Remus exclaims, dropping the wrapper and holding onto Sirius’ shoulders. “You can’t go back! You hear me, Sirius Black? Come back!” </p>
    <p>“I’m here! I’m here!” Sirius shouts back as Prime Remus shakes him. “I’m still here!” </p>
    <p>Sirius leans back on the wall when Prime Remus lets his shoulders go.</p>
    <p>Prime Remus lets out a loud exhale. “You can’t go back. You have to use the jumping pad to borrow skills and nothing more. Your mind cannot afford any more cracks. That line of thinking will get you killed, or worse.”</p>
    <p>“What’s worse than dying?”   </p>
    <p>“There are so many things worse than dying. Losing your job, getting expelled, -” </p>
    <p>“That’s your priorities? How are those things worse than dying?” Sirius asks him flatly before narrowing his eyes as Prime Remus’ eyebrow tenses. </p>
    <p>“You’re not telling me the truth,” Sirius accuses.  </p>
    <p>Prime Remus sighs softly. “How can you tell?” </p>
    <p>“The thing, with your brow. You do it when you’re lying,” Sirius says, crossing his arms. “Don’t deflect. What’s worse than dying?”  </p>
    <p>Prime Remus looks at him fondly before casting his eyes downward. “It's not important.” </p>
    <p>“Yes, it is! You want me to save the multiverse and you won’t even tell me why?” Sirius snaps at Prime Remus throwing his hands in the air. “You won’t even look at me! You know what, we’re not leaving until you tell me. I’ll scream for Barty.” </p>
    <p>“Okay, okay, just..” Prime Remus placates, running his hands through his hair. “In the beginning, we were explorers. We just wanted to see what different choices would have changed all our lives. But then news of this discovery got out and everyone began scrambling for the technology and powers from other universes.” </p>
    <p>“That’s where the Prime-verse began to fall apart,” Prime Remus says with a little bit of wonder in his voice. “All the power, all the knowledge your other lives have. Imagine never stepping foot into a medical school but being able to conduct surgery because you have done it a million times in another life?” </p>
    <p>“That would change everything,” Sirius agrees. In a world like that, Sirius would never not know what to do. Everything he wanted, he could just complete with a snap of his fingers. He would never have to work hard for anything else. in life… just take things nice and easy.  </p>
    <p>“Mhm. We could have cured diseases, and travelled the stars - there was no limit to what we could achieve with that kind of power. But like most things, people always want more,” Prime Remus grimaces. “There was a man. He wanted to be able to flit through himself but the technology was too new, too volatile. The Obscurial was just another member of a long list of people Riddle tested on.” </p>
    <p>“The Obscurial was the only successful experiment,” Prime Remus says, turning the corners of his mouth down. “But, it came at the cost of destroying his mind.”</p>
    <p>“His claypot broke…” Sirius realises.   </p>
    <p>Prime Remus nods before continuing, “Now he experiences every universe at the same time. Every single life, choice, - every single possibility at the same time. He has more knowledge than anything we can even imagine, controlling every facet of the multiverse down to the atoms with a touch of his fingers.” </p>
    <p>“The Obscureal -”</p>
    <p>“The Obscurial,” Prime Remus corrects. “His character is constantly changing and hard to predict. He has lost too much of his humanity and cannot be reasoned with. No one has been able to stop him -” </p>
    <p>Prime Remus grabs Sirius’ shoulders before affirming, “ - until now.” </p>
    <p>He starts to pull Sirius along but Sirius tugs his arm out of the hold. “You said I was the wrong one.” </p>
    <p>“That was before you jumped,” Prime Remus says smiling. “What you did back there was amazing. You were amazing. It changes everything…” </p>
    <p class="SOB-thought">You were amazing. </em></p>
    <p>The sound of crowds cheering fills Sirius’ ears. </p>
    <p>He turns around. </p>

    <p>Sirius turns around and slams into someone. The other person’s phone clatters to the ground. </p>
    <p>“Shit, sorry,” Sirius says, picking up the phone and handing it back to one Remus John Lupin. </p>
    <p>“What are you-” </p>
    <p>“I’m so sorry-” </p>
    <p>Both Sirius and Remus shut up. </p>
    <p>Sirius' mouth is gaping like a fish. Remus is the last person Sirius expected to run into at his movie premiere. They both look at each other before a giggle escapes from Remus and Sirius has to stifle a fit of laughter too. </p>
    <p>“I’m sorry,” Sirius smiles. “It’s been a while, hasn’t it?” </p>
    <p>“It has,” Remus replies bashfully. “I saw your face on the billboard and I just wondered if you remembered me.” </p>
    <p>“Of course, I remember you Moony,” the affectionate pet name falls easily from Sirius’ lips. “You look good.” </p>
    <p>When they had their short summer fling just before Sirius decided to pursue music, Remus was always in thrifted clothes and worn-out shoes. But now, Remus looks <em>good</em> in the tailored suit. His hair no longer falls across his eyes to hide the scarring on his face. He looks confident and happy. It's a good look on him. </p>
    <p>“Thanks,” Remus smiles and his small dimple makes a reappearance in Sirius’ life. “You look good too.” </p>
    <p>“Wait,” Sirius pauses. “How are you here? I thought you were getting a scholarship to university or something.” </p>
    <p>Remus laughs. “I guess I was just lucky.” Sirius can't seem to remember the last time he heard Remus laugh like that.</p>
    <p>Sirius startles as someone grabs his wrist. </p>
    <p>“Constant vigilance,” Alastor says, pulling Sirius away into the theatre hall. </p>
    <p>“Wait! Sirius, you have -”  </p>

   <p>“- to wake up!” Prime Remus screeches from the other end of the corridor. </p>
   <p>Sirius’ mind slams back into his body. He’s now huddled on the floor of a corridor by the lift lobby with his wrists handcuffed in front of him.</p>
   <p>Two police officers in uniforms crowd around Prime Remus who struggles in their hold. </p>
   <p>“Remus?” Sirius mutters out loud. </p>
   <p>“Oh thank god,” Prime Remus exclaims before babbling manically. “Sirius, you have to jump. Something else where you can fight. Maybe one where you’re in an army or the Hunger Games. You’re already handcuffed! That’s great - try peeing yourself, the algorithm really likes those -” </p>
   <p>Sirius’ brain still feels like swimming through molasses when one of the policemen swings the butt of their gun down on the side of Prime Remus’ head. Prime Remus drops to the ground with a sickening thud and Sirius snaps back into clarity. </p>
   <p>“Remus!” he cries out. The police officers ignore him as they prop up an unconscious Remus against the wall. </p>
   <p>“I don’t know what happened officer,” Barty’s voice filters down the room as he turns around the corridor with another police officer. “But my father will be hearing about this.” </p>
   <p>“Of course, Mr Crouch. Your father’s court is in session but he will be around shortly,” he officer replies. </p>
   <p>“You!” Barty sneers pointing a finger at Sirius. He’s holding a tissue on his forehead where the post-it-note was stapled before. “What the fuck did you do to me?” </p>
   <p>“I didn’t do that to you,” Sirius says defensively. </p>
   <p>Barty is cut off by the officer who presses the walkie-talkie on his shoulder. “Mad-Eye sir, there is movement on the elevator. Did you send back up?” </p>

   <p>“Negative,” a familiar voice crackles through the speaker. “It’s probably the rookies.” </p>
   <p>“Affirmative,” the officer grumbles and adjusts the settings on his walkie-talkie. “Fucking rookies, never knowing how to stick at their posts. You all are wasting a trip. The assailants are detained. Copy?” </p>

    <p>Prime Remus and the other Prime-verse crew crowd around the screens on the wall, dread filling the entire room.</p>
    <p>“Sirius, Sirius, you have to jump,” Prime Remus whispers uselessly into the mic as Prime Dorcas tries to reconnect the line back to Sirius’ watch. “Come on, run. Leave.”</p>

    <p>The lift doors slide open.   </p>
    <p>Purple smoke pours out of the lift as the lights stutter and blink back to life. A figure wearing a full cowboy regalia stands in the middle of the lift. </p>
    <p>The rim of their hat covers their face as the spurs on their boots break the silence as it clunk when they step into the corridor. </p>
    <p>“Sir, this building has been evacuated, you cannot be here,” the officer says.       </p>
    <p>The cowboy looks up, a lit cigar in his mouth and - </p>
    <p>Wait, what? </p>
    <p>“Regulus?” Sirius sputters out. </p>
    <p>Regulus ignores him, continuing to confidently make his way to the officer with his thumbs in his belt loops. Barty wisely moves out of the way and ducks behind the corner. </p>
    <p>“Now, now, didn’t your mother teach you not to lie?” Regulus takes a deep drag of the cigar, inhaling an obscene amount of smoke. He looks back up at the officer and exhales. A dense large ring of smoke floats and frames the officer’s face before dissipating. </p>
    <p>“You said I can’t be here, and yet,” Regulus tuts and plucks at imaginary dust on the guard’s shirt. “Here I am. So that can’t be true, is it? My existence here isn’t up to you.”</p>
    <p>“Okay, put out the cigar, hands behind your back.” </p>
    <p>The policemen by Remus’ body pull out more handcuffs from their belt loops and walk towards the lift. </p>
    <p>Regulus stares them down. “Are you going to make me walk through you?” </p>
    <p>“No sir, you are under arrest. Anything you say can -” </p>
    <p>“Again, with the ‘no’! You don’t understand, do you? You can’t tell me what to do...” Regulus snaps his fingers and -  </p>

            <p>The police officer explodes.</p>
        </div>

    <br/>
    <p>Sirius can only blink as the warm red liquid splatters outward, painting every surface with its dark shade. </p>
    <p>“Told you I could walk through you,” Regulus huffs, somehow not entirely covered in blood.</p>
    <p>What the fuck did Regulus just do? </p>
    <p>“Officer down! I need backup, now!” The two remaining policemen pull out their guns and train them on Regulus. </p>
    <p>“Well, this town ain’t big enough for the both of us, partner,” Regulus drawls in a southern accent before pulling out two revolvers from his belt. The policemen pull the trigger and bubbles come out from the end of the barrel with a mockery of the gunshot.</p> 
    <p>Encased within the bubbles are the bullets, bumping into each other as        
        <span class="bubble oops1">they</span>
        <span class="bubble oops2">float</span> 
        <span class="bubble oops3">away.</span>
    </p> 
    <br/>
    <p>“Always knew cops were clowns,” Regulus says with faux sympathy and the police officer’s nose begins to grow into a bright red circle.</p> 
    <p>Regulus grabs the man’s nose and smiles condescendingly.</p>
    <p>“Gotcha  
            <span class="rednose-circle">
                nose.”
            </span>
    </p>
    <p>The man drops to the floor, his round nose still in Regulus’ hand. “Ew, gross,” he says, dropping it to the floor and wiping his bloody hands on his jeans. </p>
    <p>The last officer jumps and tackles Regulus to the ground. In the moment of distraction, Sirius runs towards the still-unconscious Remus. The cuffs on his wrists make it incredibly difficult to drag Remus but Sirius needs to get the both of them out of here <em>now.</em></p>
    <p>Regulus has gone fucking insane. </p>
    <p>When he looks back at the fight, Regulus is straddling the police officer on the ground. Regulus flashes his teeth and his canines begin to grow akin to fangs. He pulls the police officer closer and Regulus sinks his teeth into the flesh of the officer’s neck - the cowboy hat still somehow on top of his curls. </p>
    <p>Sirius can only watch in horror as his little brother begins to drink the blood out of a man.</p>
    <p>He detaches himself from the man and looks up at Sirius. Regulus wipes the excess dribbling from the corners of his mouth and smiles with bloody teeth. </p>
    <p><strong>BANG. </strong></p>
    <p>The police officer drops the smoking gun from his hands and Regulus’ body slumps to the side, falling onto the floor. </p>
    <p>Horror fills his body as Sirius cannot even begin to scream. </p>
    <p>“Siri...” Regulus weakly chokes out. He tries to say something else but can only cough out more blood.  </p>
    <p>Sirius quickly crawls closer to his brother who is <em>bleeding out</em> and <em>dying</em>. </p>
    <p>“Reggie, Reggie, why -” Sirius puts his hand over Regulus’ abdomen to stop the bleeding but the blood flows in between his fingers. </p>
    <p>“Siri…” Regulus weakly says. “Don’t worry…” </p>
    <p>Regulus reaches to the wound with shaky hands before pulling out a clear tube that sprays blood over them both. </p>
    
    <p><span class="textgr-rainbow">“It's movie magic.”</span></p>
    
    <p>Regulus sits up pushing Sirius who stumbles backwards into the wall. </p>
    <p>Regulus narrows his eyes at the remaining police officer. “You are nothing but a bug,” Regulus spits out with vitriol. He pulls out a knife from… somewhere and stabs the police officer.</p>
    <p>Again. </p>
    <p><span class="textgr-huff">And again.</span></p>
    <p><span class="textgr-sly">And again.</span></p>
    <p><span class="textgr-gryff">And again.</span></p>
    <p><span class="textgr-rav">And again.</span></p>
    <p>The fluorescent lights overhead shake and sputter before<span class="textglow-halo"> glowing brighter and brighter shining on Regulus like a halo</span>.</p>
    <p>The police officer begins to scream as his body begins to disintegrate into dust. Regulus’ canines shrink until the fangs disappear from view. The cowboy hat falls from his head and Regulus begins to sparkle under the artificial light. </p>
    <p>“You -” Sirius points a shaking accusing finger at Regulus. “You’re the Obscurial.” </p>
    <p>Regulus snorts, wiping the bloody knife on the front of his shirt. “Some idiots will just slap on any random word on things they cannot understand enough to name.” </p>
    <p>“You’re the one who is trying to kill me.” </p>
    <p>“Technicalities.” Regulus shrugs, knife gesturing dangerously. “Sometimes you just die. It happens.”</p>
    <p>“The great evil that Remus was talking about,” Sirius swallows the saliva building in his mouth.<em> Oh god, he’s going to be sick.</em> “It’s you.” </p>
    <p>“In the flesh.” Regulus gives a little bow from where he’s seated on the floor. </p>
    <p>“Where’s James?” </p>
    <p>Regulus pauses with a baffled look on his face. </p>
    <p>“Are you for real right now?” Regulus looks up at him, annoyance painting his expression. “I just killed a man and you’re asking for <em>James</em>? Like I know you replaced me with him, but right now? Really?”</p>
    <p>“Did you kill him?” </p>
    <p>“No! What do you take me for?” </p>
    <p>“You just killed three people and told me you’re the greatest evil of all time!” Sirius exclaims, throwing his hands into the air. “How am I supposed to know?” </p>
    <p>“Shut it, Black.” Barty walks back out. He has an identical watch on his wrist that glows green. “There is no good or evil in the multiverse - only Goovil. It's all about perspective.” </p>
    <p>Barty drops to his knees in front of Regulus. </p>
    <p>“The Obscurial is here to free us all,” Barty exclaims breathlessly. Oh, this isn’t his Barty. Its… Not-Barty.   </p>
    <p>“Shut up! His name is Regulus,” Sirius argues. “Obscurial isn’t even a real word.” </p>
    <p>“Who gets to decide what is real and what isn’t?” Regulus hums, twirling the knife in his hands. </p>

    <p>“You’re the reason why my brother is the way he is now.” Sirius points at Regulus, the Obscurial - whatever. “You’re the reason why he’s so <em>lost</em>. That he showed up after all these years to find me - that after all that time of me waiting he finally showed up. That -” </p>
    <p>“Wait - hang on.” Regulus pauses, the knife now extremely close to Not-Barty’s chin. His classmate looks eerily calm with a blade so close to his face… Okay, Sirius will process that later. “Do you mean in this universe you’re also still hung up about the fact that I’m struggling?  That I’m at fault for finally reaching out to you? That I didn’t follow you when you left me?” </p>
    <p>“I didn’t leave,” Sirius argues. “You’re the one who chose to stay! And even then, it’s not like you to do -” </p>
    <p>“Not like me? Are you still hung up on the fact that I’m not some perfect version of your ickle little brother that you have in your head? The one who always followed mummy and daddy? Do you think I wouldn’t be strong enough to leave?”</p>
    <p class="SOB-thought">This is wrong, wrong, wrong - </p>
    <p>“Can’t you see Sirius? There is no ‘out of character’ - as long as I’m doing it, it is in character. I’m not perfect!” Regulus crouches in front of Sirius forcing them to make eye contact. “You know, your Regulus just works <em>really, really </em>hard to compensate otherwise. We do try.”</p>
    <p>“And an endless number of multiverses and you expect people to be exactly the way you want them to be.” Regulus clicks his tongue. </p>
    <p>“I know who you are,” Sirius reaffirms.  </p>
    <p>“Do you? I don’t think you even know yourself,” Regulus cocks his head to the side and hums. “There are so many versions of you, each so different from the last. But maybe some things are the same, you’ve always had a habit of ruining the one good thing you have ever had.”</p>
    <p class="SOB-thought">That shithead. </p>
    <p>Regulus’ grey eyes are wide and wild - a manic desperate being has taken over his little brother. </p>
    <p>“I’ll fight you!” Sirius argues. “I'm good at that now. I can defeat you. I can get my Regulus back.” </p>
    <p>“Okay, sure,” the Obscurial says, shrugging. “Go ahead.” </p>

   <p>The whole room begins to stink with something unsettling. The pressure of it is heavy in the air. </p>
   <p>Sirius moves to punch the Obscurial but instead, he lets out a growl. </p>

   <p>The void leaves a foggy aftertaste in Sirius’ mind. His thoughts feel like a water droplet fighting its way through a tiny crack on the surface. </p>
   <p>Sirius shivers and his eyes roll back as a wet tongue dances across the back of his neck.</p>
   <p>The person shifts and straddles Sirius’ lap, immediately hiding their face in Sirius’ neck nibbling around his Adam’s apple. Sirius puts an arm around their naked body to stop them from falling. </p>
   <p class="SOB-thought">Wait no, this is wrong. </p>
   <p>A hand scrambles to unbutton Sirius’ shirt as the mouth slowly begins to travel downward. </p>
   <p class="SOB-thought">This is wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong -</em></p>
   <p>He pushes the person away from him and opens his eyes to see Barty Crouch Junior staring back with his pupils blown wide. </p>
   <p>The walls are a soft grey and the furniture looks like something out of a fancy home decor magazine you find at the dentist. The bed is full of soft mismatched pillows and mini mountains of fabric that look divine to dive into. </p>
   <p>It's nice and cozy but Sirius wants to throw up. </p>
   <p>“Please Sirius, please,” Barty starts babbling, clumsy fingers grabbing and twisting the fabric of Sirius’ shirt. </p>
   <p>Barty’s eyes are blown wide as he lets out a pathetic keening whine. </p>
   <p>“Sirius, wha- what’s wrong?” Barty pulls back but his body is still uncomfortably close with Sirius’. Barty’s skin feels <em>hot</em> as if he is on fire. </p>
   <p>Sirius quickly pushes Barty off his lap before Barty can kiss him again and Barty just tips over, falling on his side on the plush pile of blankets on the bed. </p>
   <p>The air turns into a suffocating sticky sour weight on him that feels like eating him whole. Sirius needs to get out of here and get out now, but his body feels tethered to the bed. He tries to put one hand on his knee to push himself up but it squishes onto a wet spot on his jeans. </p>
   <p>Sirius turns his head to Barty as Barty lets out a loud sob. Sirius pulls his hand away from his jeans to get up from the bed and a glistening trail of something wet and slimy drips from his fingers. Barty curls his naked body further around a pillow and cries softly into the cushion.  </p>
   <p>The wet patch on Sirius' lap looks awfully like the one near Barty’s ass. </p>

  <p>The sweat beading down Barty’s face glistens in the glow of the night stand light and mixes with the tears falling down his face. His flush face and red-rimmed eyes is a stark contrast to the Barty Sirius knows.   </p>

    <p>“Yeah, going to that universe isn’t the easiest jump,” The Obscurial winces in sympathy, scrunching his nose as the smell of confusion permeates around Sirius. He holds out his hand to Sirius. “Give me your hands.” </p>
    <p>“No,” Sirius denies, pulling his wrists to his chest still heaving from the faulty jump.  </p>
    <p>The Obscurial rolls his eyes before grabbing the handcuffs anyway and deflating it like a balloon. “Can’t have you cuffed for this part. It’s not that kind of story.” </p>

    <p>“Haven’t seen this in a while,” The Obscurial mumbles, turning the copy of the Little Prince in his hand. He crouches in front of Sirius holding the book up to their eye line. “Sentimentality always was your fatal flaw.” </p>
    <p>He nudges Sirius’ feet making him shuffle backwards. The Obscurial tsks, “Come on now. The truth will come for us all.” </p>
    <p>“Wha-” Sirius swallows the lump in his throat. “And what’s that?” </p>
    <p>“Easy,” the Obscurial looks at him. Something curls uncomfortably in Sirius’ gut as this demon uses Regulus’ face to look so… so sad. “The truth is that nothing matters.” </p>
    <p>The Obsurcial pushes his thumb to the edge of the page before letting the pages fan through like an animation flip book. “Time to see if Prime Remus was right.” </p>
    <p>The pages keep turning and turning and turning in a seemingly never-ending cycle - a miraculous feat considering this book is less than a hundred pages long. </p>
