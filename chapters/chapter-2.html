        <p>“My Remus apologises to the door when it stubs his toe,” Sirius grumbles. “How are both of you even remotely the same person?” </p>

<p>Prime Remus clicks the door of the empty office space locked behind them and Sirius collapses onto the floor huffing. A part of Sirius hopes that maybe this is all an elaborate prank for Sirius to start working out with James in the mornings.   </p>

<p>Prime Remus plops next to him and Sirius rolls slightly to look up at him. “You underestimate how the smallest changes can affect how a person lives. With enough willpower and imagination, even the smallest ripple can turn into a tidal wave. Every tiny change, the smallest of choices in a person’s life can branch out to a different universe in the timeline. That’s how the multiverse grows.” </p>

<p>Prime Remus pulls out his watch, the digital display warping before turning into a little green flashing GPS pin with the words “<strong>University!” </strong>at the bottom. “This is your universe - the one we’re in right now.” </p>

<p>“There are other paths around it that are all the other possible universes made up of all the choices you didn’t take,” Prime Remus explains.“Green means it’s safe and it’s close to your current timeline. The ones in red are further away from your timeline. The further away it is, the more differences there are compared  to your universe - and the more dangerous it is to jump to.” </p>

<p>The infodump is almost too much to even comprehend. “A universe for everything?” Sirius asks in disbelief.  </p>

<p>“Yup.” </p>

<p>Sirius pushes himself up on his elbows. “So there’s a universe where I don’t have to worry about hell week or whatever the heck is going on now?” he asks.   </p>

<p>“Theoretically, yes.” </p>

<p>“Practically?”  </p>

<p>“Yeah, sure. One with no ‘hell week’.” </p>

<p>Sirius lets himself fall back down onto the floor. “Okay, how do we go there instead?” </p>

<p>Prime Remus pulls Sirius up to his knees and rolls his eyes, <em>again. </em>“That’s not how this works.” </p>

<p>Suddenly there is the sound of footsteps outside and Sirius’ blood runs cold. There is a slight thump as the person in the hallway makes their way towards Sirius and Prime Remus.</p>

<p>Prime Remus’ hand encircles his wrist and he’s being tugged under a desk. Prime Remus moves the chair to block them both from sight and they pause.  </p>

<p>The footsteps grow louder and louder. A figure blocks the light from underneath the  </p>

<p>Shoulder to shoulder, both of them hold their breaths, waiting for the shadow underneath the door to walk away. </p>

<p>A walkie-talkie beeps and static comes over the line. “Mad-Eye come in, there’s movement on the first floor,” the static-y voice says.  </p>

<p>“Copy,” a man grumbles from the other side of the door. “Units 2 and 3, head to floor 1 now. Stay vigilant, there is no sign of the weapon or assailant yet.” </p>

<p>The footsteps make their way further and further but Sirius still can’t breathe out. There’s a heavy weight squeezing his lungs. Whoever sat at this desk must have short legs because there isn’t any space under it. The air is hot and heavy and suffocating and <em>there is no room to fucking breathe</em>. </p>

<p>He knows he covered anxiety attacks back in first-year classes but all of that info goes flying out the window. What’s the point of taking all those classes if Sirius can’t even remember how to box breathe? Fucking useless, he can’t do anything right - not even something as simple as breathing correctly. All Sirius wants to do is go home and hide under the covers. </p>

<p>“Did you know owls have three eyelids?” </p>

<p>Sirius swallows the saliva building in his mouth and looks at Prime Remus who is fiddling with his watch.  </p>

<p>“Their eyes are also technically tubes,” he says nonchalantly.  </p>

<p>Sirius squints at him, before finally rearranging his thoughts.“The fuck?” </p>

<p>“Maybe it's different in your universe, but where I’m from, they don’t have teeth either, so they just swallow everything whole.” </p>

<p class="SOB-thought">What the fuck is he on?</p>

<p>Prime Remus turns to him with a familiar shit-eating grin when Sirius doesn’t reply. “It's something we have in common.” </p>

<p>Sirius snorts and immediately covers his mouth to muffle the sound. Prime Remus smiles softly at him. </p>

<p>Sirius breathes out before immediately wanting to burst out laughing again at the absurdity. It takes a few moments but his shoulders finally relax from where it was tensed up around his ears. Sirius leans his head back against the plastic back. </p>

<p>Prime Remus shoots him a small smile. “Better?” </p>

<p>Sirius takes in a shuddering breath and his heart slows down from its rabbit’s pace. “Yeah.” </p>

<p>“Here I want to show you something,” Prime Remus says, pressing his body closer to Sirius, letting the soft green glow of the watch shine on them both. “This is where I’m from.”</p>
