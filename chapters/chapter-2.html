    <p>“My Remus apologises to the door when it stubs his toe,” Sirius grumbles. “How are both of you even remotely the same person?” </p>

    <p>Prime Remus clicks the door of the empty office space locked behind them and Sirius collapses onto the floor huffing. A part of Sirius hopes that maybe this is all an elaborate prank for Sirius to start working out with James in the mornings.   </p>

    <p>Prime Remus plops next to him and Sirius rolls slightly to look up at him. “You underestimate how the smallest changes can affect how a person lives. With enough willpower and imagination, even the smallest ripple can turn into a tidal wave. Every tiny change, the smallest of choices in a person’s life can branch out to a different universe in the timeline. That’s how the multiverse grows.” </p>

    <p>Prime Remus pulls out his watch, the digital display warping before turning into a little green flashing GPS pin with the words “<strong>University!” </strong>at the bottom. “This is your universe - the one we’re in right now.” </p>

    <p>“There are other paths around it that are all the other possible universes made up of all the choices you didn’t take,” Prime Remus explains.“Green means it’s safe and it’s close to your current timeline. The ones in red are further away from your timeline. The further away it is, the more differences there are compared  to your universe - and the more dangerous it is to jump to.” </p>

    <p>The infodump is almost too much to even comprehend. “A universe for everything?” Sirius asks in disbelief.  </p>

    <p>“Yup.” </p>

    <p>Sirius pushes himself up on his elbows. “So there’s a universe where I don’t have to worry about hell week or whatever the heck is going on now?” he asks.   </p>

    <p>“Theoretically, yes.” </p>

    <p>“Practically?”  </p>

    <p>“Yeah, sure. One with no ‘hell week’.” </p>

    <p>Sirius lets himself fall back down onto the floor. “Okay, how do we go there instead?” </p>

    <p>Prime Remus pulls Sirius up to his knees and rolls his eyes, <em>again. </em>“That’s not how this works.” </p>

    <p>Suddenly there is the sound of footsteps outside and Sirius’ blood runs cold. There is a slight thump as the person in the hallway makes their way towards Sirius and Prime Remus.</p>

    <p>Prime Remus’ hand encircles his wrist and he’s being tugged under a desk. Prime Remus moves the chair to block them both from sight and they pause.  </p>

    <p>The footsteps grow louder and louder. A figure blocks the light from underneath the  </p>

    <p>Shoulder to shoulder, both of them hold their breaths, waiting for the shadow underneath the door to walk away. </p>

    <p>A walkie-talkie beeps and static comes over the line. “Mad-Eye come in, there’s movement on the first floor,” the static-y voice says.  </p>

    <p>“Copy,” a man grumbles from the other side of the door. “Units 2 and 3, head to floor 1 now. Stay vigilant, there is no sign of the weapon or assailant yet.” </p>

    <p>The footsteps make their way further and further but Sirius still can’t breathe out. There’s a heavy weight squeezing his lungs. Whoever sat at this desk must have short legs because there isn’t any space under it. The air is hot and heavy and suffocating and <em>there is no room to fucking breathe</em>. </p>

    <p>He knows he covered anxiety attacks back in first-year classes but all of that info goes flying out the window. What’s the point of taking all those classes if Sirius can’t even remember how to box breathe? Fucking useless, he can’t do anything right - not even something as simple as breathing correctly. All Sirius wants to do is go home and hide under the covers. </p>

    <p>“Did you know owls have three eyelids?” </p>

    <p>Sirius swallows the saliva building in his mouth and looks at Prime Remus who is fiddling with his watch.  </p>

    <p>“Their eyes are also technically tubes,” he says nonchalantly.  </p>

    <p>Sirius squints at him, before finally rearranging his thoughts.“The fuck?” </p>

    <p>“Maybe it's different in your universe, but where I’m from, they don’t have teeth either, so they just swallow everything whole.” </p>

    <p class="SOB-thought">What the fuck is he on?</p>

    <p>Prime Remus turns to him with a familiar shit-eating grin when Sirius doesn’t reply. “It's something we have in common.” </p>

    <p>Sirius snorts and immediately covers his mouth to muffle the sound. Prime Remus smiles softly at him. </p>

    <p>Sirius breathes out before immediately wanting to burst out laughing again at the absurdity. It takes a few moments but his shoulders finally relax from where it was tensed up around his ears. Sirius leans his head back against the plastic back. </p>

    <p>Prime Remus shoots him a small smile. “Better?” </p>

    <p>Sirius takes in a shuddering breath and his heart slows down from its rabbit’s pace. “Yeah.” </p>

    <p>“Here I want to show you something,” Prime Remus says, pressing his body closer to Sirius, letting the soft green glow of the watch shine on them both. “This is where I’m from.”</p>

    <p>“Come on people, keep a stable line!” someone yells into the microphone. In front of them are a legion of screens - each one showing different versions of Remus John Lupin going about their lives. </p>

    <p>The windows in James and Sirius’ flat are boarded up, with sunlight peeking through the cracks where the wood splintered from age. All of the walls are covered with various flashing screens and pictures connected by red threads on a corkboard. The sandstorm outside roils and shakes the boarded windows.  </p>

    <p>Prime Remus sits in a chair hooked up to all sorts of machinery and flashing lights. A huge headset sits on top of his face with wires sticking up from every angle.  </p>

    <p>“We call it the Prime Universe,” he says into a small microphone.  </p>

    <p>Projected on one of the screens is Prime Remus and Sirius' universe, hidden under a desk huddled up next to Sirius. As he speaks, the one on the screen does as well.   </p>

    <p>“It started when a group of scientists discovered the technology to visit another universe. The multiverse branches out based on a person’s choices - the ones they took and all the options they didn’t. But that also means that a singular individual stumbling into the right place at the right time can open a whole new world of technology and powers we at the Prime verse cannot even begin to comprehend.”   </p>

    <p>At the corner of the screen in front of Prime Remus’, there is a yellowing worn picture of Sirius in a lab coat smiling wide at the camera. </p>

    <p>He clenches his jaw before forcing himself to relax. Prime Remus closes his eyes and lets himself remember what it’s like to have his Sirius by his side again. </p>

    <p>“So, like the closet, like Prime you…” </p>

    <p>“Yes, it's all universes different from yours based on different decisions people have made. We call it Verse Jumping - now I <em>really</em> need you to pay attention because you’re going to have to master it.”   </p>

    <p>“Now?” Sirius sputters.  </p>

    <p>“It’s the only way you can make it out of here alive.” </p>

    <p>Sirius wants to gag when Prime Remus picks a chewing gum stuck on the underside of the desk and pops it in his mouth. </p>

    <p>The watch ticks and Prime Remus looks up with more clarity than before, “I can hear three guards coming down this way. There’s a group of students running. If we hurry we can blend in.”</p>

    <p>He spits out the gum and sticks it back underneath the table and Sirius has to close his eyes to hide his grimace. </p>

    <p>“We’re going to have to make a move. Follow my lead,” Prime Remus crawls out from under the table and grabs Sirius’ wrist. </p>

    <p>“Wait, stop!” Sirius tugs his hand out Prime Remus’ grasp. “Why can’t your Sirius do this?” </p>

    <p>Prime Remus looks off to the side. </p>

    <p>“My Sirius is dead.” </p>

    <p class="SOB-thought">Oh.</p>

    <p>This time, Sirius lets him pull him towards the door. </p>

    <p>“Follow my lead,” Prime Remus instructs before going out of the room and joining the other students running down the hall. In a high-pitched voice, he yells “Oh my god, oh my god.” </p>

    <p>Sirius would be lying if he said that he never thought about dying before. </p>

    <p>But to <em>know</em> another version of him <em>is</em> dead, that somehow in another life, he didn’t survive the horrors life brought.  </p>

    <p>Every university student worth their grade has joked about getting hurt or dying - getting hit by a university campus vehicle so your fees are paid for, not wearing a seatbelt when your friend is driving because if you crash and die, that’s just bad luck and destiny. When the world beats you down, it's easier to <em>want </em>to toe the line between life and death. But to actually <em>be</em> dead? </p>

    <p>His mouth is uncomfortably dry as they round another corner away from the other students and into the library. </p>

    <p>When doors close behind him, Sirius “How did I die?” </p>

    <p>Prime Remus straightens his back and starts scanning the place like a seasoned soldier. A part of Sirius wonders if Prime Remus heard him at all. </p>

    <p>Prime Remus grabs Sirius’ arm and pulls him to crouch behind some shelving. Sirius; back is against the shelf and the books dig into his spine but he can’t quite move with Prime Remus’ hand still on his arm, Sirius wonders if he should repeat the question - if it's something worth knowing. </p>

    <p>But he doesn’t have to because maybe every version of Remus can read his mind. Prime Remus’ breath tickles Sirius’ ear as he leans in to whisper, “I’ve seen you die hundreds of thousands of times.” </p>

    <p>Sirius wonders if Prime Remus can hear his heart thumping. </p>

    <p>Prime Remus takes a deep breath and says softly, “You were murdered in mine.” </p>

    <p class="SOB-thought">Murder.</p>

    <p>“Was it the, the,” Sirius stumbles over the words. How does one come to terms with their own death that has happened hundreds of thousands of times? “What did you call it? The obstacle?”</p>

    <p>“Obscurial.” </p>

    <p>“And no one really knows why?”</p>

    <p>Prime Remus makes a slight disagreeing sound. “Well, there are some theories,” Prime Remus rubs the back of his neck and furrows his brow. “Mathematically out of the millions of universes, there has to be at least one person who can defeat him right? He thinks it's you.” </p>

    <p>“Let him destroy the other universes then,” Sirius points out, inches away from pleading. “Just leave me alone.” </p>

    <p>“It's not that easy. He’s been making something. We don’t know exactly what it is, but he has garnered a following across the different universes,” Prime Remus disagrees. “You feel it, don’t you? How your clothes never quite fit the same way? Every day feels the same and your actions aren’t your own.” </p>

    <p class="SOB-thought"><s>Swiping endlessly on a phone screen in the early hours of the morning.</s></p>

    <p>“Like how you don’t even know how to be yourself or what that looks like anymore.” </p>

    <p class="SOB-thought"><s>Buying a guitar and trying to get back into old hobbies only for it to gather dust in a spare room. </s></p>

    <p>“And you spend the rest of your time wondering -” </p>

    <p class="SOB-thought"><s>Having a to-do list of all the tasks you need to get done so you can get your life on track again, but never completing any of it.</s></p>

    <p>“How can we get back,” Sirius finishes Prime Remus’ train of thought.</p>

    <p>“Exactly,” Prime Remus affirms, nodding his head. “This is the objective of the Prime Universe. We just want things to go back to the way it was - the way it's supposed to be.” </p>

    <p> “The Prime Universe’s directive is to restore the balance - bring stability back to the chaos and destruction the Obscurial is causing. And we have to start by finding the person who can put a stop to it all. Someone who can bring order back to the multiverse,” Prime Remus finishes, looking into Sirius’ eyes as if trying to study his reaction.  </p>

    <p>“And you think it's me?” </p>

    <p>“Why else would I risk it all?” </p>

    <p>Sirius wets his lip. It's dry and chapped and he can feel the skin peeling. Before he can reply, someone in the distance slams a drawer shut. </p>

    <p>Peeking beside the shelving, the two see Barty, rummaging through the clerk’s desk before pulling out a stapler. He picks up a pink sticky note and - </p>

    <p class="middle"><strong>CLICK</strong> </p>

    <p>- staples it directly onto his forehead without even flinching. Barty looks up and a small trail of blood trickles down the bridge of his nose. </p>

    <p>A creeping feeling starts crawling on Sirius’ arms and he whispers to Prime Remus, “What is Barty doing?” </p>

    <p>“That’s not your Barty,” Prime Remus fiddles with his watch. “He’s jumped.” </p>

    <p>“Meadows, where did Crouch go?” Prime Remus hurriedly asks the person next to him. </p>

    <p>Pro-wrestler? Barty is all skin and bones, a strong breeze could knock him over. Sirius peeks around the desk - Barty seems… taller. Maybe it’s because he stopped hunching and finally straightened his back but there’s no way that he could be <em>a pro-wrestler</em>.  </p>

    <p>Prime Remus pulls the sheet In a quick downward motion between his middle and pointer fingers. There is a trail of blood on the edge of the paper.  </p>

    <p>“What are you doing?”  Sirius hisses as Prime Remus lines it up in between the next two fingers. </p>

    <p><strong>SLICE. </strong></p>

    <p>Barty’s head snaps in the direction of the whispers. Kicking a piece of broken chair out of the way, Barty staggers down the aisles of bookshelves.</p>

    <p>“It's the best chance you’ve got,” Prime Remus says through the watch. “It's just like switching shoes or giving yourself a papercut. The multiverse depends on it.”</p>

    <p>“The fate of the multiverse cannot hang on if I can, what - profess my love to <em>Barty Crouch Junior</em> of all people.” </p>

    <p>“The mental load it takes to universe jump is too much for a mind to handle. The algorithm scientists developed an algorithm that calculates the improbable action you need to make that jump safely,” Prime Remus explains calmly. </p>

    <p>“The best jumping pads are the ones where you make odd choices or are completely out of character - something weird enough for the multi-universal physics itself to attempt to overcorrect and blip you across the multiverse.” </p>

    <p>“It doesn’t make any sense!” Sirius whisper-shouts into the watch. </p>

    <p>“Precisely,” Prime Remus agrees. “It needs to <em>not</em> make sense. The Algorithmic Objective Outbound Opportunities formula counts on weirdness and improbability.”  </p>

    <p>“There <em>has</em> to be another jumping pad.” </p>

    <p>“Your other options are to break your legs or sleep with him on the same bed. Are either of you tired?”  </p>

    <p>“That can’t be the only -” </p>

    <p>Dirty sneakers with loose laces stop in front of the desk. Sirius looks up to see Barty looking down at him. </p>

    <p class="SOB-thought">Shit.</p>

    <p>Barty casually flips the desk Sirius hides under. </p>

    <p>“I love you?” Sirius says meekly.</p>

    <p>Remus and Sirius are sitting on the sofa. Regulus and James aren’t home yet. </p>

    <p>“Look, I -” Remus starts. “I don’t want us to end like this.” </p>

    <p>Sirius’ lungs cannot take in enough air and there is the ghost of pinpricks on his neck. “No, no, no -” </p>

    <p>Sirius gets up and throws his fist which Barty catches easily. </p>

    <p>Sirius’ wrist burns with blinding white hot pain as Barty twists his fist. He grits his teeth not wanting to let Barty get the satisfaction. </p>

    <p>The back of Sirius’ mind knows that he has survived worse - every punch and kick his parents gave him should have thickened his skin. But it's been years since someone laid their hands on him. </p>

    <p>He’s soft now. </p>

    <p>Sirius’ face is turning red as he tries to hold in the pain. He clenches his fists in his jeans willing for some kind of control. </p>

    <p>“I don’t want to hurt you. I didn’t mean for it to end this way,” Remus says softly. “It's just - Marlene said that she and Dorcas took a break when Dorcas moved to Diagon. That the long-distance talks made them even closer.” </p>

    <p>Sirius flinches as if someone physically hits him. “It doesn’t make any sense.” </p>

    <p>“Think about it!” Remus buries his face in his hands. “We barely have a conversation where we’re not talking over each other. When was the last time we spent time together? When was the last time we <em>really </em>listened to each other?”</p>

    <p>A hand lands on Sirius’ shoulder.</p>

    <p>Barty grabs Sirius by the shoulders and tosses him against the wall by the study room. </p>

    <p>Blinking through the haze in his mind, he sees Prime Remus on the other side of the shelf, peeking through a gap in the books that block his way out.</p>

    <p>“I didn’t mean for it to end this way,” Prime Remus says softly. </p>

    <p>“No,” Sirius croaks out. </p>

    <p>“I need to find the right Sirius,” Prime Remus sighs apologetically. “This one… it's not the one.” </p>

    <p>“Wait, let me try again,” Sirius pleads, crawling towards the gap in the bottom bookshelf Prime Remus is looking through. </p>

    <p class="SOB-thought">Please.</p>

    <p>“I’m sorry, Sirius.” Prime Remus stands, his face out of view.    </p>

    <p class="SOB-thought">Let me be someone to you.</p>

    <p>There is a soft gasp on the other side of the bookshelf and Sirius can only close his eyes. </p>

    <p>“Sirius?” Remus crouches down to the gap again, glasses back on his face. “Oh my god, what happened to your face?” </p>

    <p>“Come on,” Sirius pushes himself up. Looking around the room - just like Prime Remus - Barty seems to have made a run for it too. He puts his hands on each side of the bookshelf, “Lift the other side.”</p>

    <p>They tilt the bookshelf out of the way and Remus, his Remus stumbles and climbs out. </p>

    <p>“Shit, Sirius. What's going on?” Remus gingerly wipes the blood from Sirius’ cheek.  </p>

    <p>“You left me,” Sirius mutters in a daze.  </p>

    <p>“What? I’m still here,” Remus says confused. “Is this about the internship?”</p>

    <p>“I wanted to end the semester on the right foot. But it wasn’t fair of me, especially with everything going on with Regulus,” Remus confesses quietly, his eyebrows tense. “Maybe, maybe you are right. We should have never gotten together.”</p>

    <p>“I never said that,” Sirius says lamely.  </p>

    <p>“You don’t have to,” Remus argues. “It's how you talk to me - always cutting me off and rushing to do something else. It’s how we don’t talk about anything that isn’t about school, work, or our friends.” </p>

    <p>Sirius wants to say how it's not fair, he wants to argue and shout but the words just can’t come out. </p>

    <p>The door for the spare bedroom at the end of the hallway bursts open. </p>

    <p>Standing behind Remus at the other end of the hallway is Barty. </p>

    <p>“I love you,” Sirius blurts out. </p>

    <p>Remus’ face softens but his eyebrows furrow. “What?” </p>

    <p>Sirius pushes Remus out of the way. </p>

    <p>“I love you I love you I love you -” Sirius manically chants. </p>

    <p>The watch glows yellow. </p>

    <p class="SOB-thought">Fuck, it’s not enough.</p>

    <p>“Barty? What are you doing -” Sirius cuts Remus off by grabbing his hand and running down the other direction. Sirius pulls the emergency doors open and pulls Remus down the stairs. </p>

    <p>They make it to the first landing when Barty throws the doors open again. </p>

    <p class="SOB-thought">Love, love, love -</p>

    <p>What does confessing your love even mean? Apparently, empty words that mean nothing do not affect what the universe wants. </p>

    <p>Sirius thinks back to the Barty he knows - the sarcastic little shit but one of the most intelligent people in that class. Sirius looks back at Remus who looks like he’s shaking with fear behind him. </p>

    <p>Smart but sarcastic? That’s a type that Sirius can work with. </p>

    <p>Barty gets ready to jump - like a pro wrestler jumping off the corners of the ring moments before slamming their opponent on the floor. </p>

    <p class="SOB-thought">Just stop worrying and let yourself feel.</p>

    <p>Sirius drops to his knees in the middle of the stairwell. Earnestly thinking about how Barty is actually kind of hot from certain angles and his sharp wit over text has made Sirius snort once or twice, he professes his love. </p>

    <p>“I love you.” </p>

    <p>He’s holding a guitar above his head. It is almost muscle memory with how he swings it down in front of him. His feet are planted on the ground as the momentum wants to jerk him forward. </p>

    <p>The guitar lands in front of him, smashing into a million pieces. </p>

    <p>Sirius’ heart is racing as he looks up to see a sea of people, chanting something, but Sirius cannot care as the adrenaline courses through his veins. </p>
