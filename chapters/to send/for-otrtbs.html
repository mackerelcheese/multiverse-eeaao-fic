<!--Fic Summary-->
<h2><a id="nav.3" rel="nofollow" name="nav.3"></a>Fic Summary</h2>
    <p>An exhausted Sirius Black attempts to navigate dealing with his little brother coming back into his life, working through his failing relationship, and finishing his university assignments on time.</p>
    <p>There is also an eldritch being hunting him down across the multiverse but that’s a completely separate issue.</p>

<hr/>
<!--Background-->
<h2><a id="nav.4" rel="nofollow" name="nav.4"></a>Prior background you might want to know</h2>

<details>
    <summary><i>About the Multiverse</i></summary>
    It is implied that every universe in the multiverse is a different fanwork. AHB is the only AO3 work that is directly referenced in this fic.
</details>

<details>
    <summary><i>About Regulus</i></summary>
    <p>Regulus is an omnipresent eldritch figure who is chasing Sirius across the multiverse called the Obscurial. Obscurial!Regulus is super depressed and very nihilistic. He’s trying to persuade Sirius to join him in destroying himself.</p>
    <p>Obsurial!Regulus has travelled from the Prime Universe - a universe where they learnt how to jump through the multiverse but his brain couldn’t handle everything and he fragmented which caused him to see in every universe at the same time. It's not a fun experience because in most fanworks/canon content, he is, in fact, dead, dying, depressed, the saddest guy, perpetually drowning, left behind etc.</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary><i>About Sirius</i></summary>
    <p>Sirius is the “most boring version” of himself - the college student AU trope [side note: I saw someone complaining about the college student trope being boring and I made this lol]. Through a series of “crack treated seriously” events, he is tasked with destroying the Obscurial.</p>

<!--Excerpt-->
<h2><a id="nav.5" rel="nofollow" name="nav.5"></a>Excerpt 1: Somewhere in Chapter 4/5</h2>

<p>“You see it don’t you, Sirius?” Regulus shoves Sirius through the stone archway.</p>

<!--tick-->
<p class="middle ticktest">TICK</p>

<p>Sirius falls ass-first onto the floor through the front door of an empty living room. The window shutters are an odd colour combination of red and green. The room smells like fresh paint with small cans sitting by the windowsill.</p>
<p>“We are nothing but a random arrangement of particles,” Regulus says pulling out a pencil from his pocket. “Our atoms shifting like typing and retyping every letter in the alphabet.”</p>
<p>The pencil in his hand changes and warps into an endless blend of items.</p>

<p class="middle">[TO INSERT FLASHING GIF SET - refer to end notes]</p>

<p>“No matter how hard we try, our lives will be a constant uphill battle of hurt and loss. That no matter what we do, we can’t change our destiny,” Regulus says stepping forward forcing Sirius to inch backwards. “This is just the way it goes.”</p>

<p>“I just want my brother back. Just give me my brother back,” Sirius pleads.</p>

<p>“That’s just it Sirius. I am your Regulus, and your Regulus is me,” Regulus looks at him coldly. Sirius wonders when did Regulus lose the feeling behind his eyes. “I am every version Regulus Arcturus Black.”</p>

<p class="middle">[TO INSERT FLASHING GIF SET - refer to end notes]</p>

<p>“You know what’s funny?” Regulus barks out a laugh swinging the changing tool/object in his hand. “In every other universe, Sirius Black and Regulus Black are brothers.”</p>

<p>The object in his hand stills.</p>

<p>A pink post-it note.</p>

<!--sticky-->
<p>
    <span class="pink stickyori">Hang painting here?</span>
</p>

<p>“And in every other universe, it doesn’t end well,” Regulus says looking down at the small sheet of pink paper in his hand.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you tired, Sirius?”</p>

<p><strong>[End of excerpt 1]</strong></p>

<!--Excerpt-->
<h2><a id="nav.6" rel="nofollow" name="nav.6"></a>Excerpt 2: Somewhere in the Last Chapter</h2>

<p>Oh.</p>

<p>Sirius has it all wrong, hasn’t he?</p>

<p>He didn’t think that he understood how love worked. It used to be something that he had to earn. Then it became something he took for granted and almost made it disappear. </p>

<p>But love doesn’t work like that. Love, and the shape of love, in all its forms changes with every choice, every mistake, every heartbreak, every triumph. It grows and shrinks and molds itself between people filling in every crevice it can find. It hides, runs, laughs, cries, but always always there.</p>

<p>What an honour it has been to be loved at all.</p>

<p>“Now!” Prime James yells in desperation at the crowd of Jumpers who all point their guns at Sirius. “We cannot let him turn into another Obscurial.”</p>

<p>Standing in the direct line of fire, Sirius closes his eyes and holds his breath.</p>

<p><strong>BANG.</strong></p>
<p><strong>BANG.</strong></p>
<p><strong>BANG.</strong></p>
<p>
    <strong>
        BANG.<br/>
        BANG.<br/>
        BANG.<br/>
        BANG.<br/>
        BANG.<br/>
    </strong>
</p>

<p>Behind him, Remus screams.</p>
<p class="right"><i>Sirius knows it won’t hurt that much.</i></p>
<p>"WAIT!"</p>
<p class="right"><i>Dying.</i></p>
<p>Sirius breathes out.</p>
<p class="right"><i>After all-</i></p>
<p>The bullets fly.</p>
<p class="right"><i>- it's quicker and easier than falling asleep.</i></p>
<p>He opens his eyes.</p>

<!--bullet img-->

<p>Each casing, each bullet hangs frozen in the air as if waiting for new instructions.</p>
<p>Sirius reaches out and plucks the one right in between his eyes, moments away from blowing his brains out.</p>
<p>It <i>hums</i> with opportunity in his fingers.</p>
<p class="right"><i>Change, change, change,  change, change, change, change, -</i></p>
<p class="right"><i>The story can’t end here, can it? Please please please it can’t end here.</i></p>
<p>Sirius looks over his shoulder. Remus’ glasses are askew and the cut on his forehead has scabbed and dried. Remus, oh Remus.</p>
<p>“It's okay Remus,” Sirius says smiling back at him before looking back down at the bullet in his hands. “I’m learning to fight like you.”</p>
<p>The metal changes with a tick.</p>

<p><span class="pink stickyori">Hang painting here?</span></p>

<p>Sirius cocks his head to the side and hums - almost, but not quite right. A sentence ladened with sadness and grief. What a powerful feeling that is - to feel something that strongly is to prove to the world that you are alive. </p>
<p>But the power in words isn’t just about the stories that were told but the ones that will be.</p>
<p class="right"><i>How will you tell our story?</i></p>
<p>Sirius smiles as the words begin to morph and shift.</p>
<p class="right"><i>Much better.</i></p>

<p><span class="pink stickyori">In every lifetime? In every one.</span></p>

<p>The smattering of ticks sounds that erupts as each bullet shakes and shifts in the air would put every clock in the world to shame.</p>
