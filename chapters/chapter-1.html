<!--in the beginning-->
<p>There is a small pink blob with shoes running on the screen - jumping and failing spectacularly to clear a wall. A Nintendo Switch controller gets tossed in the air as two people dive for it knocking into each other as the red controller clatters to the ground. 
</p>

<p>The sounds of gut-busting laughter fill the flat. It makes the room warm enough to chase away the biting winds of the rain outside. 
</p>

<p>There is a knock on the front door. Just one - a soft quiet thing. 
</p>

<p>Followed by another. 
</p>

<p>So quiet as if the person on the other side doesn’t want to be heard. You would need to strain your hearing to catch the soft sound but one person does anyway. After all, growing up in a home filled with alternating tension made you extra aware of every sound a house makes.  
</p>

<p>And so, Sirius Black gets up to open the door only to find his long-lost little brother on the other side looking worse for wear. 
</p>

<p>You may want to know what happens when two brothers reunite after years apart. You may want to know what they say to each other. 
</p>

<p>Did they fight? Did they cry? Maybe, maybe not - that’s not what’s important right now. 
</p>

<p>What <i> is important </i> is that the two brothers come back inside where it's warm and footsteps are allowed to be heavy on the floorboards. In the space of a moment or maybe eight, the group picks up the forgotten controllers and continues playing the game. </p>

<p>The pink blob still can’t make it over the wall to the next level. 
</p>   

<p>Someone throws a second controller in exasperation and more laughter fills the room. 
</p>

<p>It’s nice.  
</p>

<hr/>

<!--is it waking up if you never slept? sleep deprived sirius-->

<p>The only noise in the flat comes from the second bedroom near the back. 
</p>

<p>The room is small and cramped - a little bit of everything strewn on the floor as if its occupant’s entire worldly belongings exploded out of him spilling into the room. Some may call it a tripping hazard or a cry for help. 
</p>

<p>Sirius calls it what it is - no one else’s problem but his own.  
</p>

<p>He’s curled under the covers of the twin-sized bed pushed up against the wall. The only light in the room is the glow of the phone screen on his face. He could get up, turn on the light, open up his laptop, and be productive - but at this point in the night <s>(morning?)</s>, Sirius Black has forgone any semblance of being a functioning person.   
</p>

<p>“Am I the asshole for sleeping with my -” 
</p>

<p><i>Swipe.</i></p>

<p>“Will your job be replaced by AI? Here are the industries that will be -”
</p>

<p><i>Swipe.</i></p>


<p>“Today I’m going spend ten thousand dollars at this restaurant and hand food out to -” 
</p>

<p><i>Swipe.</i></p>

<p>“Another major natural disaster strikes the United States as climate change -” 
</p>

<p><i>Swipe.</i></p>

<p>“Extracting ear wax is - ” 
</p>

<p><i>Swipe.</i></p>

<p>“Behind me, I have a hundred Lego Death Stars -” 
</p>

<p><i>Swipe.</i></p>

<p>“Did I just create the song of the summer-”
</p>

<p><i>Swipe.</i></p>

<p>“Five signs you have dissociation and derealization - ” 
</p>

<p>He hits the back button and the app closes plunging the room into silence. 
</p>

<p>Sirius’ hands haven’t stopped shaking for at least the last two hours and his heart is determined to beat right out of his ribcage. He hasn’t slept soundly since… 
</p>

<p>Okay, it might be a bad sign if he can’t remember the last time he slept through the night. His eye bags are so pronounced at this point that it hurts a little every time he closes his eyes. 
</p>

<p>And when he does manage to close his eyes, the title of his assignments swims at the back of his eyelids. As much as he loves the book, there’s only so much the Little Prince and Carl Jung one man can take.
</p>

<p>The clock on his phone glares at him - 6:46 am. Fourteen minutes before his alarm rings because he decided to be the best boyfriend in the world this semester and take an 8.30 am class with Remus. At least he managed to get two, maybe three hours of sleep before waking up at 3 am. 
</p>

<p>He turns off his alarm preemptively as he makes his way out into the living room. Just because he has to be awake at this ungodly hour, doesn’t mean everyone else in the house has to be. 
</p>

<p>The last bedroom door is still ajar from last night. The insides are strewn about with all of James’ and Sirius’ worldly belongings (outside of the Potter home of course) and drunken midnight impulse purchases. Outdated emo band posters, old textbooks, and an out-of-tune electric guitar fill the room with a bunch of other junk.   
</p>

<p>At the beginning of every semester, they offer that room to Remus and Peter who both choose to continue staying at student housing like the heathens they are. Sirius shuts the door. Both he and James <i>should</i> probably get around to cleaning it but out of sight, out of mind.
</p>

<p>But not every problem can be put away behind a door.
</p>

<p>He walks down the hallway and turns to see a lump curled up on the couch in the living room - the reason why they need to clear the third room in the first place. He trains his eyes on a sleeping Regulus, watching the rise and fall of his chest with every breath just to make sure that his brother is alive and breathing and <i>here.</i>  
</p>

<p>It's not that Sirius wishes his brother wasn’t here - he loves Regulus, don’t get him wrong. It's just that - there’s no nice way to put this, but Sirius doesn’t know what to do with Regulus. He just showed up one day and now he lives here. 
</p>

<p>Well - Regulus lives on their couch and wears a mix of clothes that James and Sirius can’t fit until they can figure out what to do, but his point still stands. Sirius is happy for Regulus, he’s finally out of the clutches of their parents. Sirius has dreamed of this day for ages thinking it would never come. 
</p>

<p>And now that it’s here he doesn’t know what to do. 
</p>

<p>Do they get Regulus enrolled in the university? Sirius doesn’t even know what subjects Regulus likes anymore - it used to be mathematics but that’s when Regulus was 12 and before maths had too many letters. Does Regulus still play the piano? Does he eat his sandwiches with the crusts now? Does he still hate Sirius’ guts for being cowardly enough to run away to the Potters? 
</p>

<p><s>Is he still mad that Sirius left him behind?</s></p>

<p>His phone buzzes in his hand before he can continue spiralling and a message pops up. 
</p>

<p><strong>PETER:</strong><i> SOS. Did an oopsie. Printer is fucked - print the paper after class? Pls luv u thx</i></p>

<p>Sirius can’t help but roll his eyes before replying with a thumbs-up emoji and a quick “u owe me” back.  
</p>

<p>Just another thing on the long list of things he needs to do. 
</p>

<p>His day has barely begun and he already wishes its over. 
</p>

<hr/>

<!--everyone awakens-->

<p>By the time he gets out of the shower, Remus is already by the flat with coffee and breakfast and Regulus is using James’ shower.  
</p>

<p>Sirius’ boyfriend looks like a truck just ran him over. Ever the one who has a way with words, Remus is the go-to assignment writer while Sirius, Peter, and one (reluctant) Barty Crouch Jr research, fact-check, and plan. 
</p>

<p>The entire group is a little on edge with this paper (“It’s Interpreting the Little Prince from a Jungian Perspective” “That’s a lame title.” “Shut up James.”) since it is worth 40% of their grade for their Introduction to Theories of Personalities class.
</p>

<p>Sirius’ train of thought breaks as he takes a swig of the coffee, wincing slightly - the coffee is a little too hot and bitter, but it’ll do. 
</p>

<p>Remus slides into the seat next to him, “I wanted to talk to you about something. There’s a -” 
</p>

<p>“Mixers. We haven’t gotten drink mixers for the party tonight,” Sirius groans.   
</p>

<p>“Well, Pete said that he’s bringing the last case of Red Bull and Schweppes from Alice’s -,” Remus tries to answer.  
</p>

<p>“And cups, we got cups last time. I think we still have some on the shelf but nowhere near enough.”  
</p>

<p>“Sirius,” James calls out from the kitchen. “We know how to throw a party. It’ll be fine. Stop worrying.” 
</p>

<p>“There’s a lot of shit we need to get done,” Sirius runs his hand over his face. “I can’t barely keep anything straight.”
</p>

<p>James snorts in the background and Sirius doesn’t even have the energy to glare. 
</p>

<p>“Come on,” Remus says pulling out a sticky notepad and clicking his pen. “What do you need to do?” 
</p>

<p>Sirius exhales loudly through his nose before burying his face in his hands. 
</p>

<p>“There’s figuring out what do to with the spare room, getting stuff for the party, printing our assignment since Pete’s printer’s fucked, figuring out what the hell to do with Re -” 
</p>

<p>Sirius looks up to see Remus still scribbling on the sticky note, not even pausing when Sirius stops his tirade. 
</p>

<p>He finally looks up and tears the top note before sticking it on Sirius’ textbook. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
    1. Deal with room 3
    <br/>
    2. Buy party things - cup & mixers
    <br/>
    3. Print assignment
    <br/>
    4. Help Regulus
    <br/>
    :)
</p>

<p>“Five things to do today, it should be easy enough,” Remus says clicking his pen closed. “Just need to take everything one step at a time.” 
</p>

<p>His tongue begins to taste like ash. Something in Sirius wants to snap - wants to yell at Remus and everyone else around him. The tiny scrawls make the tasks seem less daunting - as if the weight of responsibility becomes nothing but words on a paper to be checked off.The smiley face feels like a lie. 
</p>

<p>“So about this thing,” Remus continues, painfully oblivious to Sirius’ inner bubbling frustration. He slides an open envelope in front of Sirius. “I think we need to -”  
</p>

<p>“Hey,” James pokes his head into the living room toothbrush hanging halfway out his mouth,  “Do we <i>really</i> still want to have the party tonight?” 
</p>

<p>Sirius puts his head in back his hands, “James, I mean this in the kindest way possible, but If I don’t end up  blacked out at the end of hell week, then did hell week <i>really</i> end?” 
</p>

<p>“Don’t let hell week be the start of your downward spiral into alcoholism Sirius, it’s tacky.” 
</p>

<p>“Is this because of Lily?” Remus raised his eyebrow at James. “We can uninvite the girls if that’s a problem.” 
</p>

<p>“Just because we broke up, doesn’t mean we’re not friends anymore,” James clarifies before spitting in the kitchen sink.“It was a mutual thing.” 
</p>

<p>Both Remus and Sirius share a glance before Remus comments,  “It's okay if it’s weird, and it's fine if they’re not coming. I’m sure they’ll understand.”  
</p>

<p>“No! This has nothing to do with Lily. It's more of, you know,” James jerks his head towards the shower Regulus is in. 
</p>

<p>Sirius chews the inside of his cheek. Regulus is going to hate the party. Even as a kid, Regulus had a hard time making friends.  He was always spending time alone at school and hiding behind corners at family events. 
</p>

<p>“No, we should have the party - it might be good for him,” Sirius contemplates, taking another sip of his coffee.  
</p>

<p>“See, if Sirius is fine to have the party tonight, then I’m fine to have the party tonight,” James points at Sirius and then himself. “I’m fine, you’re fine. We’re <i>all</i> fine.”  
</p>

<p>The bathroom door opens and the three wisely shut up. 
</p>

<p>Regulus steps out of the shower toweling his hair dry as the awkward silence hangs in the air. 
</p>

<p>“Sooo,” James asks Regulus, breaking the silence. “Do you have any plans today?” 
</p>

<p>“No, didn’t plan anything yet,” he replies softly, the underlying message remains unsaid. Regulus also has no plans about what to do, now that he’s here. 
</p>

<p>Its probably the first real thing that Sirius could relate to his brother in years. He could have (and has) daydreamed scenarios and what-ifs in his head for years, rewriting all the things that made him upset. And all those dreams go out the window once it manifests as the real thing. There’s nothing quite like finding your estranged brother on your doorstep after five years apart and not knowing what to do about it. 
</p>

<p>“Step one, you could get out of the house,” Remus suggests, sarcasm dripping from each word.  
</p>

<p>“Says the guy who spent the last three days at this table,” Regulus easily snarks back. 
</p>

<p>“Do what I say, not as I do.” Remus mock sighs before pointing to his face - also weighed down with the curse of eye bags. “Do you want to end up looking like me?” 
</p>

<p>And with that, Regulus cracks a small smile and something sour curls in Sirius’ chest. 
</p>

<p>Sirius can’t make heads or tails of Remus and Regulus’ relationship.For some reason, Remus can talk to Regulus like a person and get him out of his shell. Getting sentences out of Regulus is like pulling teeth for Sirius. 
</p>

<p>Sirius lets the noise wash over him as his eyelids start to grow heavier and heavier. He has to force his eyes open lest he end up face-first in his coffee. Why is it that he always gets tired when he needs to be awake but is too wired to sleep at night? 
</p>

<p>A glass shatters from behind him and he jerks back fully awake, his heart beating out of his chest. 
</p>

<p>He snaps his head to see the shattered pieces of a mug around Regulus. His little brother immediately hunches down, picking up the jagged pieces with his bare hands. 
</p>

<p>“Jesus, Reg,” Sirius exhales, putting a hand over his heart, willing it to calm down. “Just sit down.”
</p>

<p>Regulus immediately stands, clamping his mouth shut and Sirius can’t help but feel like the worst person in the world. At least Remus has already dug the broom out and started sweeping the shards of glass away. 
</p>

<p>“Sorry,” Regulus apologises, playing with the hem of his sweatshirt. Well, it was Sirius’ sweatshirt although it may have belonged to James before him. Same difference really. Regulus is drowning in the fabric, having to already roll up the sleeves several times. 
</p>

<p>Regulus is still a kid - nineteen years old, sure. But Sirius is intimately aware of how leaving an abusive sheltered life makes it feel like you’re a kid at a new school again. Each day is a battle in an attempt to navigate the unspoken rules of a place everyone else already knows like the back of their hand. 
</p>

<p>Sirius lets out a frustrated noise - he just fucks everything up when it comes to Regulus.  
</p>

<p>James stands up with his hands out trying to ease the tension, “Hey, hey, how about this? I’ll take Reg out to get all the things we need later - we’ll get a bite, a few drinks -” 
</p>

<p>“It’s not even 8 am yet.” 
</p>

<p>“- and by the time you get back, Reggie would have gotten some sunlight and no one has to worry about the party later, and we can talk about that -” James makes a vague gesture towards the cluttered room, “- tomorrow, capisce?” James finishes, slinging an arm around Regulus who cringes at the touch. 
</p>

<p>“Don’t you have other things to worry about?” Regulus shuffles under the weight of James’ arm but isn’t able to break free.  
</p>

<p>“Someone tripped the power and busted the wiring in most of the STEM buildings, and it's taking the day to replace all the lightbulbs.” 
</p>

<p>“Was it Gideon and Fabian?” Remus questions, putting the broom and dustpan away.    
</p>

<p>“It was Gid and Fab,” James nods profoundly before turning back to Regulus smiling, “So, just come and hang with me.” 
</p>

<p>Sirius glances over at the clock and winces - he doesn’t have time for any of this today. 
</p>

<p>“Fine, fine,” Sirius concedes. “Just remember to get the good cups, none of that paper crap - there’s still a stain on the couch from where Frank’s cup disintegrated at the bottom.” 
</p>

<p>“Ah yes, single-use plastic here we come.” James sarcastically fist-pumps the air.  
</p>

<p>Getting up, Sirius takes quick stock of his bag - keys, wallet, ID card, umbrella, laptop, charger - 
</p>

<p>Wait - no charger. Fuck. Another icing on the perfect start to an already shitty day. 
</p>

<p>“I can’t find my laptop charger,” he says dumbly out to the room.  
</p>

<p>“Where’s the last place you had it?”, Remus cringes as Sirius turns his bag upside down unceremoniously and all the contents come tumbling out onto the table. 
</p>

<p>“If I knew where it was, then it wouldn’t be lost would it?” 
</p>

<p>Sirius sifts through the small pile on the table when a hand reaches out and picks up the book he spent the last two weeks rereading for the paper. 
</p>

<p>“You took this?” Regulus asks, staring at the copy of the Little Prince in his hands. The book is worn and held together with hope, dreams, and tape. He flips it open to see the pages lovingly taped back together and a faded stain from where Regulus spilt his juice when he was 6.    
</p>

<p>“I thought they threw it out,” Regulus remarks softly before placing it back on the mound of things uncovered from Sirius’ bag.
</p>

<p>The book was one of the only things that Sirius took with him when he ran away at 16. Nothing but the clothes on his back and a small backpack of things he cannot replace. 
</p>

<p>He can feel the tips of his ears turning pink with embarrassment - after all this time, he’s still attached to some stupid kids' book enough to force his classmates to write a whole assignment about it. 
</p>

<p>“Actually -  forget it.” Sirius shoves the rest of the junk into his bag, walks to the door and grabs his shoes from the rack. “There’s no time, we’re already late. I’ll look for it later.” 
</p>

<p>Remus snatches the ignored envelope and book from the table before sliding it into his bag. 
</p>

<p>There was simply never enough time. 
</p>

<hr/>

<!--lift scene-->

<p>They only have about 15 minutes left before the lecture starts by the time they make it to the building. 
</p>

<p>Sirius taps his foot on the tile impatiently. The lift in these old buildings takes forever. Maybe Sirius should take a page out of Gideon and Fabian’s book and set something on fire so the university management has to replace it. 
</p>

<p>“So, I wanted to talk to you about a thing,” Remus tugs on the strap of his bag slung over his shoulder. “I got this letter and -” 
</p>

<p>The lift bell dings. 
</p>

<p>“Fucking finally,” Sirius mutters stepping into the lift, Remus trailing behind. 
</p>

<p>“So, I wanted to talk to you about a thing,” Remus tugs on the strap of his bag slung over his shoulder. “I got this letter and -” 
</p>

<p>Sirius’ phone vibrates. Pulling it out, he sees a message from James. He taps it open revealing a picture of a very put-out Regulus and smiling James walking by a park. 
</p>

<p>“ I can’t believe James managed to get Regulus out of the flat,” Sirius says slightly impressed. 
</p>

<p>Somewhere beside him there is an audible ‘tick’ sound and Remus lets out a sharp exhale.  
</p>

<p>Sirius winces, right - Remus had something he wanted to say. “Sorry,” Sirius shoves the phone into his pocket only to be met with Remus pinning him against the wall of the lift. The palm of Remus’ hand is flat against the wall behind Sirius, their bodies touching in ways they really don’t have time for on the way to class.  
</p>

<p>“Remus, there are cameras here,” Sirius chastises, slightly bewildered. “And why’d you take off your glasses?” 
</p>

<p>“They can’t see you from here,” Remus tilts his head towards the camera in the corner, still staring at Sirius intently. True enough, Remus’ arm blocks the camera’s view of them. 
</p>

<p>“I don’t know what’s going on Rem, but we -” 
</p>

<p>“Shh,” Remus whispers, his breath warm on Sirius’ cheek. Sirius has to consciously remember how to breathe. “Once we walk into class, there is going to be a storage closet at the back of the room. I want you to think about going into that closet.” 
</p>

<p>“What on earth are you talking about?” 
</p>

<p>Remus ignores his protests, pulling out the envelope from his bag and a marker before scribbling on the back. 
</p>

<p>“Once we sit down, follow these instructions step-by-step,” Remus shoves the envelope into Sirius’ hand. 
</p>

<p>“And take this,” Remus presses a black digital watch into Sirius’ other palm. “You’ll need it.” 
</p>

<p>“Where did you get this watch?” Sirius turns the items in his hands. The screen is sleek and luxurious - way more than what Remus would be comfortable spending on a good day. 
</p>

<p>Sirius gasps slightly as fingers softly tuck underneath his chin as Remus tilts Sirius’ face upward to meet his gaze. 
</p>

<p>“Remus, you’re kinda freaking me out.” Sirius blinks up at him. Sirius cannot remember a time when Remus looked at him like this - it's like he hasn’t seen Remus in years. Remus’ eyes studied every inch of his face as if he were going to recreate Sirius’ likeness in his clay.  
</p>

<p><i>The fuck?</i></p>

<p>Remus reaches out to tuck a flyaway strand of hair behind Sirius’ ear and leans in close. “Just follow the instructions, okay?” he murmurs into Sirius’ ear. Sirius swallows deeply and nods. 
</p>

<p>Something else beeps and Sirius looks at Remus’ wrist where a matching silver watch sits. 
</p>

<p>“When did you get a watch?” Sirius says bewildered, “You don’t even like silver?” 
</p>

<p>Remus’ watch beeps again. “There’s no time to explain,” he says, pulling his glasses out of his jacket pocket and sliding them back on. “I’ll see you soon. Just follow each step. The world depends on it.” 
</p>

<p>Remus’ shoulders suddenly drop and his arms go limp at his side like a puppet without its strings. 
</p>

<p>Heart thumping in his chest, Sirius reaches out to poke his cheek, “Remus…” 
</p>

<p>“Huh,” Remus turns to blink harshly at him before readjusting his glasses. “Sorry - must have zoned out. What were you saying?” 
</p>

<p>The lift dings and the doors open. 
</p>

<p>Remus glances at his phone, “Shit, we’re late.” 
</p>

<p>He wraps his hand around Sirius’s wrist and tugs him along as the lift doors close behind them.  
</p>

<hr/>

<!--classroom scene-->

<p>“Good morning class,” McGonagall greets from her desk at the front of the room. 
</p>

<p>“As you all know, there will be a quiz next week, so for today, we’re just going to do a quick recap of everything we have covered so far - that means everyone here should already be prepared.” Her glasses slide to the edge of her nose as she stares down the students in the hall. 
</p>

<p>She pulls out a clicker from her desk, “We will start with Psychoanalysis by Sigmund Freud.” 
</p>

<p>The whole class groans in unison. 
</p>

<p>Remus is sitting next to him, listening intently and shuffling his papers every once in a while. Sirius peeks to see the other students in the row, many of whom were sleeping or trying not to sleep, although one student just pulled out a loaf of bread and what looks like a chocolate spread - oh the joys of sitting in the back of the class. 
</p>

<p>It's hard for Sirius to concentrate in class sometimes (read: all the time). In most of his classes, Sirius felt like there wasn’t enough stimulation to let him concentrate on the lecture. As much as he did like McGonagall, it wasn’t enough. Usually, he would spend the lecture either playing repetitive games like solitaire or pinball just so it would quiet all the other thoughts in his mind and he could focus on what the Professor was saying. And he would do that - but his laptop charger is missing and the battery is on the verge of dying. 
</p>

<p>Sighing, Sirius pulls out the watch and the envelope from his bag. The watch is nothing special, it's one of the new digital smartwatches every other gym bro has complete with slight scuff marks on the black paint on the side. 
</p>

<p>On the back of the envelope is Remus’ sprawling handwriting large enough to take up the whole side. Sirius raises an eyebrow as he scans the page. Remus is usually the kind of guy who would usually keep his handwriting small to not waste all the space he could jot down his thoughts and ideas. 
</p>

<p>But weirder things have happened this morning. 
</p>

<p>Written in blue ink is a set of instructions - most likely one of James’ elaborate pranks. They hadn’t pulled a prank in a while - something was bound to come up sooner or later. 
</p>

<p>McGonagall is still droning on about Freud and his daughter. Sirius gives a silent prayer to thank god the group chose a different topic for their assignment in this class. 
</p>

<p>He looks back at the envelope and scratches the back of his head, why not? The lecture is boring and he has nothing to lose. 
</p>

<!--instructions -->
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>1. Put on watch</i></p>

<p>Easy enough. Sirius slips it on his wrist. The watch strap itself is slightly loose but the black digital numbers light up all the same. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>2. Switch shoes to wrong feet</i></p>

<p>Sirius leans forward to take a look at his trainers and wiggles his toes. It doesn’t look like James or Remus messed with it - no weirdly tied laces or questionable paint. He toes his trainers off and swaps them. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>3. Imagine yourself going into the closet</i></p>

<p>Sirius snorts, he spent his whole life in a closet - even got kicked out of Grimmauld for it too. He relaxes his body and lets his mind wander to the storage closet at the back of the classroom anyway.  
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>4. Hold on tight and press the button on the watch.</i></p>
<p style="text-align: center;text-decoration: underline;"><i>Don't forget to breathe!</i></p>

<p>Sirius squints as the watch glows a bright green - that's weird. 
</p>

<p>He moves his wrist closer to his face to inspect it. It must be some kind of heart rate-detecting technology. Just how much money did James spend on a prank like this? 
</p>

<p>Sirius presses the button on the side of the watch. 
</p>

<p>The sounds of his classmates settling in their seats start to fade away.
</p>

<p>His lungs feel like they are compressing and stretched out as if its two different states of matter at the same time. His arms feel heavy like a non-Newtonian fluid replaced the blood in his veins. 
</p>

<!--sideways-->

<p>His thoughts begin to<span class="l-strech1"> feel soft, and pliant before being</span><span class="l-strech2">stretched and twisted around </span><span class="l-strech3">like a rubber band.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center;">A sharp pain starts from the middle of his forehead</p>

        <p>“We don’t have much time,” he whispers. “First thing, I’m not your Remus. I’m from another universe.”</p>

<p>“Thank you for your contribution Mr. Black,” Professor McGonagall continues as if students losing their minds is a normal occurrence - which honestly, for a Psychology professor, it probably was. She stares at him pointedly before continuing, “I still have about 5 minutes left, so I do hope I am permitted to continue.”</p>

<p>Sirius flushes. He can tell the whole class is staring him down.</p>

<p>“Now, I know most of you have already submitted your essays, but to those who haven’t please make sure to put what theory you’ve used and which book you have analysed on the cover page. I will be grading you on how well you can analyse behaviours and thoughts through different theoretical lenses and perspectives. The final submission is today at 5 pm.”</p>

<p>“Please also be mindful of the word count. While highly appreciated for its accuracy, I cannot be marking another novel, Ms Evans.” The whole class laughs as James’ ex-girlfriend blushes and hides her face in her hands.</p>

<p>The class ends and people start filing out of class.</p>

<p>“Are you okay? What was -?”</p>

<p>His stomach roils and he closes his eyes to stop his mind from spinning wildly out of control.</p>

<p>“I’m fine Rem. Just tired. Thought I heard something.”</p>

<p>He closes his eyes and lets his forehead rest on the table. He knows that Remus is judging him, another thing to worry about - Sirius is finally losing his mind. Time to lock him up and throw away the key for the next twelve years.</p>

<p>His heart is still racing. There is no way that was some kind of cruel prank.</p>

<p>So either Sirius has truly lost his mind, or the multiverse is real. And someone, something was looking for him.</p>

<p>When he opens his eyes again, Barty Crouch Jr is walking towards them - towards Remus.</p>

<p><i>Just stop worrying and let yourself feel. Follow your gut.</i></p>

<p><i>It’s up to you to save us all.</i></p>

<p>Barty already killed Prime Remus, there was no way he was going to let him kill this one too. Now Barty stalks up towards them, steps sure and unwavering - like a predator catching his prey.</p>

<p>And that’s when Sirius stands up and punches Barty in the face</p>

<p>Barty yelps, grabbing his nose. “What the fuck is wrong with you?”</p>

<p><i>Oh shit, okay Barty is not a murderous stone-cold killer. </i></p>

<p>“I was returning Remus’ thumb drive, you <i> asshole </i>,”  Barty grits out, tilting his head forward, and blood drips onto the floor. Some people have their phones out, cameras pointing at them.</p>

<p>Remus is up on his feet, apologising profusely, pulling out some tissues from his bag. “Keep your head down. Yeah, that’s it. Hold the tissue, yeah, there you have it.”</p>

<p>“What is your problem, Black?” Barty looks up at him, blood staining the front of his shirt.</p>

<p>“I’m sure he didn’t mean it, Crouch. Rough morning and all that,” Remus swoops into the conversation, trying to placate Barty “Just needs a rest, don’t we all?”</p>

<p>“He should be behind bars, that's what he needs,” Barty spits out.</p>

<p>Remus turns back to Sirius, throwing his hands in the air, “What did you do that for? Is this because of the letter?”</p>

<p>“Yes! The letter! You’re the one who told me to do this!” Sirius hisses out only to be met with total confusion from Remus. He pulls out the envelope from his pocket and waves it in the air. “You said that I know the time to fight and I was special.”</p>

<p>“Are you crazy? I’m talking about this!” Remus exclaims exasperated, snatching the envelope, the words on the back staring directly at Sirius.</p>

<p>“Okay, so you know about this? It’s not just the Star Trek version of you or whatever?”</p>

<p>“Star Trek-? This letter was mailed to me. Of course, I know what’s in it!”</p>

<p>“Okay, so you just get random letters telling you to do things that don’t make sense and you just go along with it?”</p>

<p>“It’s not so crazy to want something new!” Remus’ voice falters. “I just wanted to try something different. Something just to live a little.”</p>

<p>Remus lets out a small huff crumpling the envelope in his hand, “I wanted you to come with me. But I guess it’s clear that you don’t want me around, do you? That you just have to push everyone away.” </p>

<p>“What the fuck is going on with the both of you?” Barty interjects.</p>

<p>From the corner of his eye, he sees Remus turn the envelope around, mouthing out the instructions written on the back confused. “‘Put on a watch’? Sirius, you hate watches.”</p>

<p>“You gave it to me!”</p>

<p>“No, I gave you this,” Remus pulls out the letter from within the envelope.</p>

<p><strong>ACCEPTANCE FOR RESEARCH INTERN POSITION AT NORTH FORD UNIVERSITY</strong></p>

<p>“North Ford?” Sirius mumbles before looking up at him. “That’s hours away.”</p>

<p>“I know,” Remus answers flatly.</p>

<p>“So what, you’re moving?”</p>

<p>Remus looks to the side, avoiding eye contact.</p>

<p>The realisation kicks in all at once for Sirius. “You’re leaving me.”</p>

<p>The only confirmation that Sirius needs is how Remus continues to avoid looking at him. What kind of asshole would break up with Sirius and not even have the decency to look him in the eye?</p>

<p>“So you think James and Lily broke up and suddenly it's fine?” Sirius angrily spits out, “North Ford is what - a train ride away?! It’s barely long distance.”</p>

<p>“No, I just think that we need to have a talk - ”</p>

<p>Remus doesn’t even get the chance to finish before the classroom doors swing open.</p>

<p>“What’s going on here?”</p>

<p>Sirius whips his head around, only to find three campus security personnel walking towards them.</p>

<p>“He punched me.” Barty points at Sirius. “Fucking broke my nose.”</p>

<p>“Okay, kid,” one of the campus security has his hands out at Sirius as if dealing with a criminal, “you need to come with us.”</p>

<p><i>Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck -</i></p>

<p>Sirius stands up, his hands are shaking. Maybe they haven’t stopped shaking from the night before but who is keeping count? Not Sirius - maybe he’ll have time to keep track in jail. Oh my god - Sirius Black is going to go to jail. He’s too young for jail.</p>

<p>That’s when Remus steps in front of him.“Yeah, I don’t think so,” he drawls out almost lazily.</p>

<p>The security guard shifts his weight, fingers brushing the taser on his belt. “Okay then, you’re coming with us too. Hands where I can see ‘em.”</p>

<p>“Remus, please” Sirius pleads, putting his hands up. He’s so getting kicked out of school - picking fights and being high on campus? What a joke. “Just do what the man says.”</p>

<p>Instead, Remus takes off his glasses and puts them in his front shirt pocket. He turns behind to look at Sirius - and winks.</p>

<p>Wait, wait, <i>what</i>-</p>

<p>“Sir, I need you to put your hands where I can see them and step to the side.”</p>

<p>“Okay.” Remus slowly pulls his hand out of his pants pocket with his fist closed smiling at the guard.</p>

<p>Uncurling his fingers, Remus reveals a box of sour candies and thumbs it open. The security personnel are confused, clearly not knowing what’s going on</p>

<p>He holds the the box right underneath his nose and abruptly takes a deep whiff breathing in all the sour candy dust.</p>

<p>“You’re both insane,” Sirius hears Barty say from the sidelines.</p>

<p>He hears a soft tick come from Remus’ watch.</p>

<p>Prime Remus stands tall as he pulls out something long and pointy from his other pocket and points it at the guards.</p>

<p>“Stupefy!” There is a flash of red light and the guard's limbs stiffen and he falls face-first to the ground like a cardboard cutout.</p>

<p>Both remaining guards look at their colleague who has fallen face first on the ground, limbs stiff.</p>

<p>The other guard presses something on his walkie-talkie, “We need back up at block A24.” They pull out the batons from their sides, “Kid, you don’t want to do this. Put the weapon down.”</p>

<p>Alarms start to go off around the building. <i>Fuck fuck fuck-</i></p>

<p>Prime Remus lifts the stick again and murmurs something. He makes a swish-and-flick motion at the guards, which sends them flying towards the ceiling. Another quick jab melts the ceiling tile, making the guards stick above them.</p>

<p>“What are you doing?!” Sirius yells to Remus, ignoring the cries from above them.</p>

<p>“You know a thank you every once in a while would be nice.”</p>

<p>“You’re -” Sirius points at Remus who rolls his eyes at him. Yup, his Remus is never this mean.</p>

<p>“I thought you died!” Sirius shoves Prime Remus’ shoulder.</p>

<p>Prime Remus rubs where Sirius just hit him, “No, that was a burner universe - something temporary where we could talk. I got shot back into the Prime-verse. I wasn’t planning on doing anything until you decided to punch someone!”</p>

<p>“Which reminds me,” Prime Remus jabs him on the chest with the stick. “Why did you do that for?”</p>

<p>“Barty killed you! And you told me to be strong and fight - and so I did.” </p>

<p>“That was another Barty,” Prime Remus rubs the bridge of his nose before grabbing Sirius’ arm and leading them out of the room down the hall. “Just because someone was in another universe, doesn’t mean that they are jumping or that it's the same person. Sometimes it is, but most of the time it's not - there’s too many universes.”</p>

<p>An alarm starts blaring throughout the campus. Prime Remus sighs, “Come on, we should go.”</p>

<p>“Is that a wand? Did you just do magic?!” Sirius follows behind him.</p>

<p>“Magic is one of the easiest powers some of us can get no matter which universe or timeline we’re on - no clue why though,” Prime Remus shrugs, tucking the wand back in his pocket.</p>

<p>Sirius turns around to see the guards are well and stuck in the ceiling, “Should we bring them down?”</p>

<p>“No time,” Remus stands in the doorway waving him along hurriedly, “Come on, let’s go.”</p>

<p>Okay yup, no time to unpack your thoughts about the people stuck in the ceiling because a version of your boyfriend used <i> fucking magic. </i></p>

<p>The hallway is abandoned, with random bits of paper and a lone shoe strewn about. Sirius closes the door behind him and turns to Remus, “So Barty didn’t kill you?”</p>

<p>“A version of Barty did, not your version - another one. And he didn’t kill me, he killed another version of me in the temporary hold universe.”</p>

<p>They reach the emergency stairs at the end of the hallway and pull it open. Remus starts to climb up two steps at a time. Fuck, when did he get in shape?</p>

<p>“So this is all real then? I’m not going crazy?”, Sirius follows him slightly out of breath.</p>

<p>“As real as anything we will ever be,” Prime Remus says, pushing the door into the floor above.  Prime Remus pokes his head down the hallway and looks around, surveying the room before pulling the door open into a small meeting room.</p>

<p>“Come on,” Prime Remus pulls him into the room. “We made too big of a change. There is no way the Obscurial won’t know we’re here. We’re going to have to make this quick.” </p>

<p>The door shuts behind them.</p>

<!--burner universe tick-->
<div class ="middle l-strech4"><strong>tick</strong></div>

<p>A loud crack reverberates around the room as Barty twists Remus’ neck and he falls straight onto the floor of the supply closet. Bellatrix stands behind him from where she threw the knife at Sirius.</p>

<p>Barty turns and raises his hands to the crowd, blood dripping down his sleeve.</p>

<p>“The Obscurial is coming,” Barty crows to the crowd from the front of the locked broom closet. There are three holes in it courtesy of Mulciber and his fire extinguisher. The body of one Remus Lupin lies on the ground, broken and bloody courtesy of Barty himself. </p>

<p>The only other sound in the hall is the steady dripping of water from the air conditioning vent on the tile.</p>

<p>Drip.</p>

<p>Drip.</p>

<p>Drip.</p>

<p><span class="textgr-bluegreen">Tick.</span></p>

<p>A hooded figure appears at the back of the room. His fingers run across the back of the chairs in the front row, feeling every atom and rearranging them into something more… <span class="textgr-rainbow">fun.</span></p>

<p>“We have been killed, scorned, tortured, forgotten, and cast aside in every lifetime - in every other universe. Now we have the chance to take back what is rightfully hours. The Obscurial is our salvation.”</p>

<p>The air in the room is thick, as if a heavy layer of air has settled itself on top of the crowd.</p>

<p>“He is here to save us all from the endless misery of time. We must all do our part to complete his mission.”</p>

<p>The figure slowly claps from the back of the room.</p>

<!--Obscurial Reveal - Kirby Deadpool-->

<p>At the front of the crowd, Barty drops to his knees with a sickening thud, looking up at the Obscurial. At this moment, Barty would jump off a cliff if the Obscurial wanted him. Barty was predictable in that way - in every other universe, Barty was like a dog begging for scraps of attention.</p>

<p>The crowd parts like the Red Sea for the Obscurial, cowering up the aisle, pressed up against the sides of the chairs in the lecture hall. They huddle close to the ground leaving the Obscurial the only one standing in the room.</p>

<p><span class="thoughtread">This should be easy.</span></p>

<p>Obscurial makes his way up the steps, each step evenly paced and carefully calculated - his hand hovering above the heads of the students.</p>

<p>"<span class="txt-blue">Duck</span>." A hand stops in front of Peter turning his hair blue-</p>
<p><span class="thoughtread">nope.</span></p>

<p>"<span class="txt-purple">Duck</span>." The palm doesn’t even make it halfway to Alice’s face before she starts trembling. Her shirt starts glowing purple.</p>
<p><span class="thoughtread">A shame.</span></p>

<p>"<span class="txt-green">Duck</span>." Frank slams his head against the edge of the chair behind him. Both he and the chair turn neon green.</p>
<p><span class="thoughtread">That's <i>booooring.</i></span></p>

<p>“Uh huh,” Obsucrial tuts letting his hand finally rest on Barty’s hair. He twists the strands between his fingers before tugging it harshly, making Barty face upward.</p>

<p>“Lucky goose,” the Obscurial coos. ”You found something for me?”</p>

<p>Barty nods fervently and swallows, “He’s in the closet - Sirius Black. He jumped here with the traitor.”</p>

<p>Obscurial lets go of Barty’s hair and steps over Remus’ body - this one looked like he didn’t even put up that much of a fight. Prime Remus is losing his touch. The Obscurial huffs, at least a little fight would make this more interesting.</p>

<p>He crouches beside this Universe’s Sirius, a pink plastic birthday cake knife jutting out in between his ribs. Each breath from Sirius sounds shallow and broken. </p>

<p>“Come on, wake up,” he slaps the side of Sirius’ face. A wet gurgle escapes and blood spills out of his mouth before he stills. His head lolls to the side completely lifeless. A line of colourful liquid leaks from Sirius’ nose and onto the Obsurial’s gloved finger. Obscurial wipes the soiled finger on the lapel of Sirius’ jacket instead.</p>

<p><span class="thoughtread">How <strong>dissapointing.</strong></span></p>

<p>“I need him alive,” the Obscurial says standing up. “You all have failed me.”</p>

<p>Barty opens his mouth again, a string of promises ready on his tongue.</p>

<p>“Shhhh.” The Obscurial puts one finger on Barty’s head and Barty crumples like a wet tissue. “I don’t need you now.”</p>

<p>Everyone in the room flinches as Barty falls to the ground, clutching his head, and lets out a guttural scream.</p>

<p>The Obscurial closes his eyes and lets the screams become static sounds that wash over him.</p>

<p>The Obscurial lifts his hand palm side facing upwards before curling his middle and ring fingers back down towards the heel of his palm.</p>

<p>Regulus is at the campus bar holding a glass of juice. He has his hoodie pulled up over his curls but it doesn’t do much to muffle out the sounds of students' day drinking.</p>

<p>“Look, I know we didn’t get off on the right foot,” James waves his hand while talking across from him. “Sirius means a lot to me and I know he means a lot to you, Baby Black.”</p>

<p>“But Sirius he…,” James sighs, his finger drawing circles on the table with the condensation from his pint mug. “Sirius means well, he just has a hard time showing it. We just need to get along and make his life a little easier. There’s just a lot on his plate right now. But he does love you.”</p>

<p>Regulus can’t help but huff. Sirius always has a funny way of showing how much he cares about others.</p>

<p>The TV above the bartender stops the football match broadcast to cut to breaking news. Regulus cocks his head to the side.</p>

<p>“There has been an attack on the campus of the university. So far there have been no casualties. There are two security personnel injured. Reports on the ground have said that one of the assailants has an unidentifiable biological weapon.”</p>

<p><span class ="thoughtread"><i>Finally,</i> something <strong>interesting.</strong></span></p>

<p>“The police department would like anyone who has any information please call the -”</p>

<p>Grainy CCTV  of Sirius and Remus pop up on the screen. Remus is holding something pointy in his hand with Sirius cowering behind him.</p>

<p><span class="textgr-bluegreen">Bingo.</span></p>

<p>“What the fuck?” James says in disbelief and stills his hand. “Is that Sirius and Remus?”</p>

<p>Regulus hums, “Looks like it.”</p>

<p>James turns and looks directly into his eyes</p>

<p><span class ="thoughtread"><i>Oh,</i> how he has missed those eyes.</span> James’ voice starts to fill with panic, “This isn’t good. We should probably call someone.”</p>

<p>“It's okay, I got it,” he smiles at James.</p>

<p>Regulus is unlucky in this universe - this James looks kind. James’ eyebrows furrow and Regulus wants nothing more than to reach out and smoothen it out. </p>

<p>“Babe, I’ll be right back, okay?” he promises, leaving a kiss on James’ cheek and patting it before sliding off the bar stool.</p>

<p>He leaves a confused James sputtering and trying to settle their bill with the bartender instead.</p>

<p>He makes his way to the university, carefully weaving through the growing crowd out front and dipping underneath the police tape through the barricade.</p>

<p>Maybe this Sirius is the one. Only one way to find out.</p>

<p>Ready or not, here he comes.</p>
